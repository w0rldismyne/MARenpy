We've tolerated awful, toxic people for so long for the sake of entertainment. Bad guys think they get to be heroes just because they tell us they are. Well, no more!

How I long for the days when costumed heroes and villains could battle for dominance in broad daylight. All this sneaking around that has to be done now, just to keep others from intervening, it's demeaning to both of us.
