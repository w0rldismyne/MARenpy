    #background Nagen’s Room

    kk "Good morning, brotato chips!"
    kk "We’re going to start this school year with a banging opening ceremony in the amphitheater before classes start."
    kk "You got one hour to be up and ready this morning."
    kk "And now, a request from the heart, an original mix by your’s truly to start your day with fighting spirit."

    "I wake up to a song I’ve never heard blaring from an old radio alarm clock. My dorm is uncomfortably cold compared to my bed, but I have to cross the room in order to get to it.*"

    n "Ugh, where’s the off switch on this thing?"

    "From outside my door, I can hear a rush of activity and a loud bang."

    h "Come on, Nagen, we got to get going if we want to sit together."

    n "Just save me a seat, I’ll meet up with you later."

    j "I tried that, he wouldn’t stop knocking until I opened the door."
    j "Do NOT let him in."

    h "If I don’t bug you guys, you’ll just go back to sleep and we’ll be laaate."

    "The banging increases tenfold."

    j "I can’t stop him. His desire to be annoying is too strong."

    h "Open the doooor."

    "I get dressed in record time and slip out before either of my friends can barge in."
    "Jona could only restrain one of Hiro’s arms at a time."
    "It was a valiant effort, but he could be dragged wherever Hiro wanted to go."

    j "Where’s your school stuff?"

    n "In my locker, you nut case."

    j "Sorry."

    h "Come on, Uitto’s saving us a spot with her giraffe legs. We gotta go."

    "I’m hoping that means she’s ready to talk to me, but when we get to the amphitheater, Hiro and Jona immediately sit on either side of her."
    "She’s ignoring me in favor of her own reflection."
