    #background Nagen’s Room

    kk "Good morning, brotato chips!"
    kk "We’re going to start this school year with a banging opening ceremony in the amphitheater before classes start."
    kk "You got one hour to be up and ready this morning."
    kk "And now, a request from the heart, an original mix by your’s truly to start your day with fighting spirit."

    "I wake up to a song I’ve never heard blaring from an old radio alarm clock."
    "My dorm is uncomfortably cold compared to my bed, but I have to cross the room in order to get to it."

    n "Ugh, where’s the off switch on this thing?"

    "From outside my door, I can hear a rush of activity and a loud bang."

    h "Come on, Nagen, we got to get going if we want to sit together."

    n "Just save me a seat, I’ll meet up with you later."

    j "I tried that, he wouldn’t stop knocking until I opened the door. Do NOT let him in."

    h "If I don’t bug you guys, you’ll just go back to sleep and we’ll be laaate."

    "The banging increases tenfold."

    j "I can’t stop him. His desire to be annoying is too strong."

    h "Open the doooor."

    "I get dressed in record time and slip out before either of my friends can barge in."
    "Jona could only restrain one of Hiro’s arms at a time."
    "It was a valiant effort, but he could be dragged wherever Hiro wanted to go."

    j "Where’s your school stuff?"

    n "In my locker, you nut case."

    j "Sorry."

    h "Come on, Uitto’s saving us a spot with her giraffe legs. We gotta go."

    "I’m hoping that means she’s ready to talk to me, but when we get to the amphitheater, Hiro and Jona immediately sit on either side of her."
    "She’s ignoring me in favor of her own reflection."

    h "You can sit next to me."

    u "Did you get ready together or something? What took you so long?"

    j "I didn’t unpack anything yesterday, sorry."

    u "Next time, just send someone ahead. You know I hate-"

    k "Well well well, your entourage is real after all."

    "Uitto lets out an ugly sigh."

    k "Though I suppose anyone can catch attention with the amount of makeup you put on. Careful not to touch, boys, I heard she doesn’t use sealing spray."

    u "They could care less what I’m wearing, and so should you. This thing you’re doing, it’s not cute. Just go sit down somewhere, these seats are clearly taken."
    
    "She sounds so tired. I’m able to grab her attention and silently ask if she knows this girl from before."
    "Uitto pantomimes a long winded ‘no’. Kitsune, completely oblivious, sits on Jona’s other side."

    k "I could have my fans follow me around all the time, but I was afraid it would make me too unapproachable."
    k "People could get the wrong idea and think I’m a stuck up attention hog."
    
    u "People will think a lot of things no matter what you do. I retired so I could stop worrying about my image."
    
    "I can practically hear the wheels turn as Kitsune tries to think of a comeback."

    n "Did you want to watch the assembly with us?"
    
    k "H-hunh?"

    n "Isn’t that why you came here?"

    k "N-no-"

    n "Then why did you sit down?"

    k "I just wanted to talk to Uitto, so-"

    n "What exactly did you want her to say to you?"

    k "....."

    "She gets up quietly and leaves to sit with some other girls."

    u "Thank god. I seriously don’t know what I’d do without you guys."

    h "Why didn’t you just tell her to go away?"

    u "It’s the first day of school."
    u "I’m not going to shit on someone’s self esteem for seeking validation, that’d be pointlessly cruel."
    u "It just sucks that the one person who wanted to talk to me just wanted to compete against me on stage."

    "We’re interrupted by a comical scale of trumpets as the vice principal bounds on stage. Principal Vivaldi follows close behind in silence."
    
    ik "Welcome, everyone! I hope you all had a good night’s sleep!"

    "No one responds."

    ik "We’ll work on that later. Right now, we wanted to remind you all of a few important school rules before classes start."
    ik "With a lot of hard work, we hope this place can become like home to you."
    
    v "All students are to remain on campus at all times."
    v "That means staying out of the wooded areas surrounding the school."
    v "It’s easy to get lost out there and we don’t want anyone to get hurt."
    
    ik "There is a zero tolerance policy toward anyone who commits an act of violence or aggression."
    ik "Hurting another student, or threatening another student, will result in immediate detention."
    
    v "Finally, no student is allowed in the computer lab without an instructor present."
    v "This is to ensure a safe environment."
    v "It is also the reason many of your electronic devices were confiscated before entering the dorms."
    v "We apologize for any inconveniences this might have caused."
    
    "They didn’t even let me transfer my music onto their cheap burner phone. At least I know my stuff’s safe with Maimai."
    
    ik "Now to end on a happier note, here’s Mariko with some announcements about school clubs."
    
    m "How’s everyone feeling this morning!?"
    
    "We murmur amongst ourselves with one brave soul demanding more sleep."
    
    m "Sleep is for the weak willed! You lot have spent the last year and a half lazing around already."
    m "If we’re going to make it through another year, we have to face it with fist full of fire!"
    
    "Her little speech inspires laughter. It may not have been the reaction she wanted, but it’s lifted the mood."
    
    m "A-anyway, the point is, this year could really suck if we don’t have the right attitude going in."
    m "Anyone that wants to make a club has to gather at least three interest members before all the faculty advisors get snatched up!"
    m "So, if you have the guts, you should join the cheer squad."
    
    "She scans the crowd. With each passing moment, her bravado falters. She’s shaking."
    
    m "I-if you do, you can learn how to do this."
    
    "She launches into a backhandspring and lands perfectly on her feet."
    "Without music, her routine feels awkward, and I can tell her nerves are getting to her."
    "It makes it all the more horrifying when something cracks during her floor routine."
    "She fumbles to the ground the minute she tries to stand."
    
    re "Mariko!"
    
    "Her friend rushes out to get her, followed by Mu at a lethargic pace. Mariko tries to shoo them away."
    
    m "I’m fine. God, this is embarrassing."
    
    mu "Stop trying to put weight on it, stupid, there’s a reason you lost some range of motion."
    
    m "I said I’m fine. People are staring."
    
    "Rei swiftly hoists Mariko onto her back."
    
    re "Just humor us and let us take a look at it later."
    
    "She turns to us with a grin."
    
    re "She’s a-okay everyone! If you’re interested in joining, talk to me or Mariko!"
    
    "Mariko buries her face into Rei’s back as she’s carried off stage."
    "Everyone claps out of pity. The second hand embarrassment is palpable."
    "After the assembly, we’re handed our class schedules. I’m stuck with English, P.E., Science, and Proficiency Management."
    "They wanted me to take the Intelligence course, but I can always switch it if I want to."

    #NEW STUFF
    
    #BG: Hallway
    "It’s surreal being thrown back into school life without my friends in every class. Back at Estella, we had been clumped together for everything year after year. Hearing the bell ring is a relief."

    "The hallways swarm with a stampede of students. No doubt many of my classmates had also packed up several minutes before the bell, waiting for the floodgates to open. As I wade through the crowd to meet up with my friends, the PA system sparks to life."

    PA: "Attention all students."

    "That voice isn't human. Or, if it is, it’s distorted beyond recognition. The disturbing pitch is enough to interrupt everyone's conversations."

    PA: "I would like to commend you all for overcoming your fears to be here today. Many of us are still recovering from the Guwon Riots. Our bodies, families, and minds have been torn apart, which is why it pains me to announce this school is not the safe haven it appears to be. No doubt you've noticed the surrounding town has been abandoned, evacuated, no signs of reconstruction for miles. It's the ideal place to put a school; if you don't want your students to leave."

    "A staff member bolts out of the classroom and down the hall."

    "Mr. Yaguchi tries to cover the voice from the PA with his own instructions, but it’s too late."

    PA: "Nagen Tesuta, Uitto Hanatabe, Jona Oshima; you have five days to turn in your leader, Hiromichi Morine. If he is not restrained on the practice field by then, the punishment will be tenfold. Only the valiant shall escape the shore of corpses."

    "The message cuts out. I assume, on blind faith alone, that whoever is responsible will be caught. Everyone is staring. Everyone knows. They may not have beforehand, but now it’s like being under a spotlight."

    re "It's not true, is it?"

    "Rei, my old classmate, refuses to be shepherded away from us by her friends."

    re "Guys, tell them you had nothing to do with riots. There has to be a mistake. We were all together. We-"

    mu "Why did you think they were missing during the evacuation?"

    re "Nagen was sick, and I saw Hiro."

    "Rei glares at Mu with tears in her eyes."

    re "He came back to get us. The gym wasn't safe so we had to relocate, isn't that right? Hiro, tell them, please. Tell them the truth."

    j "Do you want him to tell the truth or tell them he wasn't involved? He can't do both."

    n "Jona, stop helping."

    re "You lied to us!?"

    y "So wher-re are the other-rs?"

    n "There were no 'others', it was just us."

    d "All of you knew. You knew, and then you just show up here like nothing happened? How long were you planning to lie to us?"

    t "Does it matter? What's done is done."

    i "Do you want to take your licks all at once or in small doses throughout the year?"

    ch "Violence begets more violence. Demanding retribution will only further the cycle, no matter how deserved. Deliverance should only have been provided to the ones it was owed."

    u "We don't owe you shit. You don't like that we're here? Fine! Then leave us the fuck alone. We didn't come here to start shit, we came because we were forced to. If anyone lays a hand on Hiro, I'll claw your eyes out."

    re "...you're not even going to apologize?"

    "Rei pleads with her last bit of hope. Everyone else looks on with a mixture of grief and loathing. Uitto stands between us, acting as a rage-filled human shield. I can hear staff thundering down the stairs after us."

    "Why am I getting scolded? I didn't do anything. They're the ones that swarmed around us like piranhas. Whoever targeted us doesn't just want justice, they want to humiliate us. For that, I’ll make certain their plan backfires. After the halls have emptied, I turn to my teammates."

    n "I'm going to find who did this."

    h "Guys, we can't go around talking like this, people hate us enough as is. We're supposed to be laying low, remember?"

    j "We've already been exposed and you're their main target, Hiro. Are you suggesting we sit back and watch you get attacked?"

    h "No one said anything about being attacked."

    u "Either way, a bounty's on your head, and it made everyone think it was okay to come for you."

    n "I'm not saying we have to start a fight with them, but Uitto's right. If we don't see this through, other people could jump on the bandwagon. With one message, they've butt fucked my campaign and our chances at going through school under the radar. I'm going to find them and shut them down."

    u "The lil' bitch gotta pay."

    h "You two are impossible."

    j "I'm not against helping, if you have a use for me that is."

    h "Guys... Okay, fine. But no one gets hurt. We got a reputation to fix."

    g "Reputation can be gained or lost during events. You can increase your reputation by helping other students. This is not the same as alignment. A villainous character can have a good reputation."

    g "Click on items to see if it leads to any clues."

    CD: "I can't make sense of this organizational system. Why aren't they alphabetized?"

    Computer: "Nothing is queued to play. The browser history isn't terribly exciting. Just a bunch of Google searches on troubleshooting home assistants."

    kk "I get you're ticked off, but don't drag my equipment into this. I already lost half my tech today, I can't lose Pepper too."

    u "Pepper?"

    kk "My boom mic. Now get out. I'm the only one who's managed to keep PA privileges and I plan to keep it that way."

    h "Alright, fine. We'll leave you alone with... Pepper."

    "I think I have enough to start questioning people, but where to start?"

    g "When questioning students, allies can be used to quickly gather testimonies from students they share a class with. Be careful using second-hand testimonies; sometimes things get lost in translation. Hanging out with classmates will give you bonuses in their Major. Each Major has different strengths; experiment to see which works best for you."

    "I’ve done a decent job distracting myself today, but it's getting late. Everyone I know has gone to bed. My arms are tired from recreating the oldest recognized constellations on my ceiling with glow in the dark stickers. I lay there, tracing the patterns with my eyes until the stickers lose their glow. In the darkness, I fall victim to my overactive mind."

    Dark: "Everything is ruined. They're coming after Hiro and then you're next."

    "My chest burns."

    Dark: "You need a new plan. Then a plan for when that one fails and then another."

    "I need to sleep. I have class in six hours. Just stop thinking and sleep already."

    Dark: "You don't deserve sleep. Not until you fix everything you've broken."

    "The pain is sudden. It feels like I've been stabbed with a screwdriver. I search my chest, but nothing looks any different than yesterday."

    Dark: "Even your body's broken."

    "Even though I know it's my imagination, I turn on the light and check again, just in case."

    "Another day has come and gone. I try to drown out my thoughts with the tinny music on my phone, but not too far in, my mind wanders. Why target Hiro?"

    Dark: "He was the leader of our army."

    "But he wasn't terrible. He at least tried to make an effort to call people by name, even when they couldn't respond."

    Dark: "He never listened."

    "As the days went by, Uitto started reporting the wounded to me. He wouldn't take his headphones off and she didn't feel like fighting with him over bad news. I was the strategist anyway; his duty as a recruiter had long since finished."

    Dark: "Something was off."

    "He never changed into the uniform we gave him. All of us were still mourning Lethe at the time... but I don't think he changed his clothes at all after his first mission."

    #[BG: Cafe]
    "P.E. is always the worst. I have to change in and out of sweat soaked clothes and half the guys in my class have yet to discover deodorant. After class gets out, I’m left with two options; feel gross the rest of the day or shower in public... I’m in the middle of regretting my decision at the lunch table when Uitto snaps her fingers in front of me."

    u "Essays! If you help Hiro with his writing assignments, I will consider that an adequate apology."

    n "Hunh? Really, that's the blackmail you're going to go with? I expected you to draw out the silent treatment a little longer."

    u "Well, Hiro's too embarrassed to ask for help and the workload is stressing him out. I'm sure if you were the one to offer a hand, he would gladly accept."

    n "I'm not letting him copy my homework again."

    u "Of course not, but you could proof read his stuff for him. You know how defensive he gets over his dyslexia and we'll be stuck writing papers for the next three years..."

    n "I hate editing."

    u "I know."

    n "....."

    n "Fine."

    "She beams that sickeningly sweet smile of hers as Jona and Hiro join us at our table."

    u "Nagen, isn't there something you wanted to say?"

    n "Uitto's blackmailing me into being your study buddy for English."

    u "Excuse me?"

    h "Uitto, I told you I’m fine."

    j "Considering how often you correct Word, I think she's justified in her efforts."

    n "And just because I agreed to do something doesn't mean I'm going to lie about why I'm doing it. You are blackmailing me, and I'm not going to risk taking the blame if he doesn't want my help."

    u "But there shouldn't be a problem with accepting help from a friend, right Hiro?"

    h "...no. Which means there's nothing more to talk about."

    j "You're ly-"

    h "Nothing more to talk about, Jona. Nothing."

    "The poor guy is getting treated like a toddler. I have to do something."

    n "Whose idea was it to put P.E. at the beginning of the day? Now half the class is going to reek and be sore all day."

    j "The uniforms have no sleeves!  It's so freaking cold, but they won't let me wear my jacket because it's not school appropriate gym wear."

    u "It is basically a trench coat."

    j "Exactly! It covers more than half of what the girls wear. How is that inappropriate?"

    "The two go on an hour-long tangent about the odd uniform restrictions, completely forgetting about Hiro. Hiro breathes a sigh of relief."

    [BG: Nurse's' Office]
    "I can't keep putting off going to the nurse. The pain in my chest won't go away and it's started to climb up my neck and shoulder. When I finally work up the courage to go to the office, I don't see the nurse, just him."

    mu "What's the matter? You look pale. Well, paler than usual."

    n "Nothing, really. I'll just come back later."

    "I can hold out a little while longer."

    mu "She's not going to be in for two weeks. That's why I'm here."

    n "That long?"

    mu "She works for two other schools and a hospital. I'm here to book appointments and keep idiots with colds from bothering her. So, why do you need the nurse, you've been by the office at least three times."

    n "It's nothing."

    "I turn to leave."

    mu "Shoved something in your penis or anus?"

    n "WHAT!? NO! What the hell are you writing down!?"

    mu "Well, you clearly need medical help and you won't tell me what it is. Usually when that happens, it's something sex related."

    n "That's not what's going on damn it!"

    "He looks at me expectantly, his eraser poised over the paper. The longer it takes for me to answer, the more he'll think I’m lying."

    n "Just put down port care."

    "He sets down the pencil. If I didn't know any better, I'd think he was concerned."

    mu "Is it hurting?"

    n "Why do you care? I thought you hated me."

    mu "So? I'm not a monster. If something's wrong, I can call the nurse, but she'll want to know what's wrong with it first."

    "I reluctantly agree to have him take a look, peeling open the front breast pocket of my under shirt while he gloves up. The disk embedded in my chest aches as he pushes down and around it. He hisses, probably because the whole area is swollen and warm."

    mu "For starters, I think it's flipped. I can try flipping it back over by hand, but it'll hurt. Like, a lot. Why do you have one of these anyways?"

    n "I hate needles. This made life easier."

    "With the number of drugs my father wanted to test on me, it was better to have a direct line to the heart than to dig around my arms looking for IV access in between scar tissue."

    mu "I guess what I should have asked is do you still need it? Cause if it's broken, it'll have to come out anyway."

    "Obviously, I'd rather not touch it at all. It's why I spent the last two months pretending like it wasn't there. But the thought of going back under a scalpel scares the shit out of me."

    n "Please, just, try to fix it."

    "He nods and dials the nurse on speaker phone. Of course, the first thing she tells him to do is grab an inch-long needle. The minute I see a glimmer of silver, I feel my knees give out."

    Nurse: "What happened?"

    mu (panicked) "I forgot to make him sit down. I'm so sorry."

    "He keeps waving the damn thing in the air as he panics. When I wake up again, I have two lines coming out of my chest and an antibiotic running above my head. He sheepishly informs me that the nurse will be by in two days to see me in person."

    m "Thank you!"

    s "It's just until you can find more members!"

    "So Mariko's still scraping together her squad. And with that, I get an awful idea."

    n "Have you tried asking Uitto?"

    m "No... Why, do you think she'd be interested?"

    "A whole bunch of manic girls chattering about school spirit and teamwork would be her living nightmare. It’s also the perfect way to get back at her for earlier."

    n "I know she's looking for a club to join, but so far she's had problems finding a place to fit in. Talking to new people doesn't come naturally to her."

    s "She does avoid the other girls in our class like the plague."

    m "I see what you're trying to pull, Tesuta. The poor girl must be so shy! Don't worry, even if she doesn't join, we'll make sure she feels welcome."

    "Mwahahaha."

    n "Thanks guys! Oh! And please don't mention I said anything about this to you guys. If she knows I asked you to talk to her, she'll think it's a prank and avoid you even more."

    "My shoulder is still kinda sore, but I can rest a little easier knowing that I’m not crazy. I honestly expect people to have formed a lynch mob or something by now. Granted, being casually avoided doesn't feel great either, but it's better than what I expected. If you had told us when we ran away we would have come here, I think Hiro would’ve been the only one to go through with it."

    Dark: "He couldn't sneak out."

    "A week after we ran away, we realized he only brought a few things in his backpack. He said it was because he forgot when we were leaving. That's when Lethe asked if he left a note."

    Dark: "They made him go back."

    "He was too scared to grab his stuff, of course he didn't leave a note. I emptied out one of my pistols and lent it to him so he could feel safe. Odori even checked the cylinder to make sure. The house should have been empty when he went."

    Dark: "He came back empty handed."

    "I tried asking him what happened, but he wouldn't answer me. Everything became about saving as many of our classmates as he could. He didn't want anyone to get hurt again."

    #[BG: Courtyard]

    "I decide to eat lunch early today. Jona has run off to work on god knows what and Uitto is getting chased around by the cheer squad. That leaves me alone in the courtyard with Hiro. He’s bouncing around, boxing his shadows, carefree as ever."

    h "You know what I miss the most? Fricken Naga Rangers. I've looked all over the stupid library-school thing and there isn't a single movie or comic book to be found."

    n "Probably because it's an old library. Besides, even if you found a DVD, there's nothing here that would play. The closest thing we got is the CRT TV in the junk pile on the roof and that'll only take tapes."

    h "I guess you're right. Man, this is like getting marooned on an island!"

    n "It's almost as if they want you to spend your freetime learning."

    "He turns to me with a look of pure terror."

    h "This place will be the death of me."

    n "Really? That's what rattles you?"

    h "What do you mean?"

    n "Compared to cryptic death threats, homework seems like the least of your worries."

    h "I don't remember anything about a death threat, just some coward begging for an unfair fight. I mean, seriously."

    "He laughs a bit."

    h "I'm not going to give some rando the satisfaction of scaring me. If they really wanted to face me, they should have stepped forward and said it to my face."

    #[If Hero]
    h "I'll be fine, you guys worry too much. I don't need to be guarded 24/7."

    n "I'm not guarding you. I just thought it'd be nice to have lunch-"

    h "You've barely eaten anything though."

    "Crap, he caught me."

    n "Okay, so maybe we're taking turns shadowing you a bit, but can you blame us? I don't want you getting hurt when there's something I can do."

    h "We all made our own choices, Nagen."

    "Yeah, but if he knew everything Odori and I knew, I don't think he'd have followed along with our plans."

    h "We thought we were helping people. I'm sure everyone will understand that eventually. It's just going to be a little harder now."

    #[IF VILLAIN] 
    h "I wonder if it would be better to just turn myself in."

    n "What!?! No, no way."

    h "But think about it, Nagen. If we agree to meet with this person, it'll show we don't mean anybody any harm."

    n "We're not just going to roll over and let these people kick us while we're down."

    h "They're scared of us, Nagen."

    n "Not nearly enough, it seems. If they were really scared of us, they wouldn't have deigned to threaten us in the first place. No, they have to think they have some kind of edge on us. The sooner we squash it, the better."

    h "I just think it would do us some good to show our classmates we were human under our masks, just like them."

    n "You're talking like you want to quit being a hero."

    h "....."

    n "Did you let them trash your gear?"

    #[Return to Main Branch]

    h "Man, this conversation got super heavy fast. I know this is a fancy boarding school or whatever, but is it so hard for us to have one normal day?"

    n "The minute I find a Monster and a console, I'll let you know."

    h "Dude, I'd take a plug and play at this point. I don't understand how they expect us to be better versions of ourselves when there's nothing to do."

    n "You could always try this."

    "I hand him a colorful novel with a Naga Ranger cover. His excitement is extinguished the moment he opens it."

    h "Aw man, it's a book-book."

    n "This place is basically a library. It's full of them."

    h "Hardy-har, Nagen, reading's only fun for you because you think it's easy."

    "What's that supposed to mean? As vast as the collection is, there is quite a number of fictional books. And I've even found something from his favorite series. It seems I'll have to find something else to hold his attention."

    #[BG: Classroom]

    "I didn't think too many people would be interested in clubs, especially with so few students here. Maybe that's still true. Why else would my friends and I get accosted by club leaders?"

    mh "Come on, you guys, this is the smartest idea I've had in a while. But it'll only work if we have enough members."

    u "I don't think anyone will join if we're in your club, no offense."

    n "Why don't you ask some of the Charisma Majors?"

    mh "I already tried, but they hear 'gaming club' and think it's for dorks."

    h "Gaming? Like video games?"

    mh "I asked the teachers if I could bring my old GameStation collection, y'know, since it predates online stores. They said yes, if I share it with club members."

    h "What games do you have?"

    "Before Momoko can seal the deal, Chisei bellows from down the hall."

    ch "Hark, deceiver!"

    "She’s not terribly fast, but she makes up for it by shouting as she walks."

    ch "You promised a fair duel. I thought such trickery was beneath you."

    mh "This isn't one of your plays. All's fair in love and war, baby."

    u "Don't we get a say in this?"

    mh "I just need names to put on a paper. You don't even have to show up. It's the least you could do."

    h "What's that supposed to mean?"

    "Oh no. That's not good."

    mh "What, I'm not allowed to bring up that you're a criminal at all now? It was just a joke."

    h "I'm not a criminal!"

    "Chisei joins our group slowly, although much more hesitant than before."

    mh "My guy, you put mind control devices on people, that's gotta be a crime. Just own it."

    h "We were trying to protect people."

    mh "Yeah, we all felt really protected wearing bombs. Just ask Chisei."

    ch "Please do not."

    "Our eyes are collectively drawn to her scars."

    n "We didn't- There shouldn't have-"

    mh "They tried to take it off her by force aaaand boom."

    ch "I said stop!"

    mh "...but everyone already knows."

    ch "Our time here should not be defined by our scars or misplaced guilt. And if I hear you trying to use other people's lives as a weapon in an argument, I- Well I do not know what I can do, but I will most certainly sever my connection to you."

    "I don't think I've ever seen Chisei this angry before. Momoko apologizes, but there’s little she can say to pacify her. Honestly, I’m mostly in shock and I can sense the others were as well. The Eclipse Collar was never meant to do that kind of damage. There shouldn't have been anything in it that could do that."

    h "What club are you running?"

    "Leave it to Hiro to just side step around a heavy topic."

    ch "You do not have to ask just because you feel sorry for me."

    h "You're a writer aren't you? Is it a reading club or something?"

    "He soldiers on, and eventually her mood lightens."

    ch "No, a drama club."

    h "So you need actors and junk? I could do that, if you actually want me in your club."

    "She pulls out a crumpled piece of paper from her backpack. All things considered, it seems she has more than enough people to form her club."

    ch "We do not have a set meeting time yet, but I would like to accommodate everyone's schedule if I can."

    "She collects his signature and leaves with a small smile on her face."

    j "Were they only interested in Hiro? I guess some things never change."

    h "What do you mean? We're all going to join again, aren't we?"

    j "Do I want to repaint the same sets over and over again? Not for free."

    n "I was never in drama club to begin with. It was just you guys."

    h "I guess we just used to talk about it a bunch... Right! You had that weird performance anxiety thing."

    u "Pfft."

    n "SOCIAL anxiety. Thousands of eyes, all pointed at you, actively judging every syllable you say. Not for me. I get enough of that at home."

    h "Whatever, point is you clam up in front of a crowd. I guess it's just me and Uitto this time."

    u "Actually, I'm with Nagen on this one. I'm not just retiring from the pageant circuit, I'm retiring from performing entirely. One of the reasons I'm here is the school can't use me on the stage or in photos."

    h "Oh... So it's just going to be me?"

    n "It'll be okay. By the time they want to meet up, we'll have caught your anonymous attacker."

    h "That's... okay, I guess."

    u "You'll be fine, you'll see!"

    #Day 4 Night
    #[BG: Nagen's room night]

    "Over the last few days, it’s felt like things are almost normal now. At least, for me it feels normal. None of the kids really wanted to hang out with the 'teacher's pet'. The things I wanted to talk about didn't make sense to other kids and I couldn't figure out how to find common ground. It's why I was so jealous of Hiro when we were kids. He didn't have to try to make friends. He just had them. I lashed out so much back then."

    Dark: "He never fought back."

    "No matter how much I fought or yelled, he'd just smile at me like whatever we were fighting over wasn't a big deal. It frustrated the hell out of me that I couldn't shake him. Our arguments got so bad, the school had to get involved."

    Dark: "I watched him drive off with his dad."

    "That night, he had called me, asking for my help fixing something. I don't know why Odori gave him my number, but I had the upper hand for once. I'm ashamed now at how long I let him dangle. How could I have known? All he asked for was a needle and thread, I didn't know why it was so urgent that I met up with him. I thought he ripped his pants or something."

    Dark: "He never told me what happened."

    "His face... it was unrecognizable. He wanted me to give him stitches, like I'd seen in a documentary, but bones were broken. We should have gone to the ER, but he was afraid of getting in trouble."

    h "It'll heal. It always heals, but if things aren't in the right place, it'll heal wrong. I can't do it myself this time, it's kinda hard to see right now. Please, you're the smartest person I know."

    "I couldn't convince him to see a doctor, so I did the best I could. It's my fault it didn't heal like it should. By the time I was finished, I was shaking, but he just laughed."

    h "I can't keep getting into fights at school, Nagen."

    Dark: "It's the only scar he has."

    "By Monday, all that was left was a gash where the stitches hadn't lined up quite right. No one at school thought anything of it when he said he fell. I wonder how often he got hurt and we just didn't know."

    "Damn it."

    k "Do you think I'm pretty?"

    n "Why do you want my opinion?"

    k "I assumed you like girls and I feel like my makeup is making my face look gross, but I don't know how to fix it. So then I thought maybe it's all in my head and I actually look fine."

    k "-stupid platform lady-stilts. What kind of vague nonsense are you trying to pull here?"

    n "That's why I asked if you really wanted my opinion. I don't think you're ugly, which is why you shouldn't be fishing for compliments."

    k "I wasn't-"

    "She cuts herself off, unable to think of a reasonable defense."

    k "Okay, so maybe there was a bit of coaching on my part. What else am I supposed to do, let people ignore me?"

    "She slams the door to her locker shut."

    k "I did not spend this much time getting ready just to fade into the background. Ugh! I can't be bummed like this or it's going to show up in all my headshots. Thanks anyway, Nagen. I gotta go get my manic pixie energy back. Good luck today."

    #-Intro-

    y "Careful wh-where you step!"

    "I freeze, foot in the air, with the door to the stage half open. The floor is littered from end to end with carefully overlapped pieces of sheet music. I slowly open the door and find a safe place to stand. Yoku is in the center of it, a little more disheveled than usual."

    n "Are you... okay?"

    y "I- Well, I guess it does look per-ertuburbing to an outsider. Th-there is a method to the madness, I assure you."

    n "I hope so. Is this all from the library?"

    y "It holds a sur-rprising wealth of reference material."

    n "Does the staff know you pulled out all these pages? I'm pretty sure the collections are supposed to be 'intact' while we're here."

    y "....."

    y "They fell out."

    "I’m trying so hard to keep a straight face, but I think he can hear me stifling a laugh."

    y "Clearly you can see I'm preoccupied at the mo-oment. What did you want?"

    #-Alibi-

    y "That morning, I had to report to the classroom early to perform my duties as class representative. It ssseems I'm the only one that wants to come into class twenty minutes early."

    n "You got that right."

    y "Re-reguardless, that morning there was an alarm coming from one of the lockers on the second floor. It was from one of those dubstep/crunk songs that were everywhere befor-re the riots. Very irritating. I asked the council to take care of it. I haven't heard it since."

    "A ringtone maybe?"

    n "What are you doing exactly?"

    "He looks up unamused."

    y "Name on-ne person outside of this room that would have a use for sheet music."

    n "What about Kazz?"

    y "Ha! That wannabe disc jockey couldn't tell B major from G shhharp minor."

    n "...what's the difference?"

    y "There is none, he wouldn't know tha-at either. His idea of writing music is dragging and dr-ropping sound clips. Which is... fffine. I just doubt he'd use these over his machines."

    n "I suppose that's fair." #(+Mysterious noise)
    
    #-CDs-

    n "This is going to sound silly, but would you be able to look at this picture and tell me if there's anything special about how these CDs are organized?"

    y "No."

    n "I was afraid that was the case."

    y "There's no or-rder to them at all. Either that or they were arranged with person-nal taste in mind. Where did you take this picture?"

    n "The AV room."

    y "That's why. Kazz let his friends pick ou-ut what they wanted to hear before he star-rted accepting requests. One of the perks of bein-ng a DJ. It'll be June before I hear any cl-lassical music on the air."

    #-Outro-

    n "Well, thank you for taking time out of... whatever this is to talk to me."

    y "....."

    n "Uh, bye, I guess."

    "I quickly close the door and hear the flutter of papers getting flung into the air."

    y "NOOOOO!"

    n "Sorry, I-"

    "Shit, I better get out of here."

    #[BG: Amphitheater]

    "Rei might not want to talk to me, but if I want a clear picture, I need to talk to everyone. I find Rei practicing her old floor routine on the outdoor stage. She juggles her plastic sword mechanically, focusing on throwing it as high as she can. Normally she moves with more grace and joy."

    n "Hey, can we talk?"

    n "Rei-"

    re "I just feel so stupid. We were all in the same class together for four years. It was like having a second family to me. I constantly worried about how we were going to stay together when we got older only to find you don't think about me at all."

    n "Rei, it's not like that-"

    re "It's not just you. No one here- I think I'm the only one that thought we were all friends."

    "There are definitely people here I could have gone my whole life without seeing again. I don't think there's anything I can say to make this right, but..."

    n "I wanted to keep everyone safe too. That's why I couldn't leave you behind. I really was relieved to see you again, even if you don't want to talk to me again."

    re "I don't want to be mad at you. I really don't. If we're going to stay friends, you can't hide stuff from me. You gotta show me the same trust I showed you."

    "I didn't realize how close Rei felt to everyone. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to have someone this loyal on my side."

    re "Kitsune brought it to practice looking for the owner. Mariko recognized it right away and said she'd take it back to him. Maybe she hasn't been able to track him down yet; he's been literally all over the place lately..."

    "Still, it wouldn't be hard to leave a note on his dorm or something."

    n "So you didn't see her give it to him?"

    n "What about flag line? That's why you brought all your armaments, isn't it? There isn't a lot of opportunity for you to dance if you’re a cheerleader."

    re "Most of my stuff's been confiscated. It'll take weeks to make decent prop replacements. Besides, cheer is more accessible to rookies than twirling."

    n "That sounds like Mariko talking, not you."

    re "She needs this more than I need flag line. Anything to make this place feel like a normal school, a place to make new friends, will help her. She's really starting to worry me."

    n "She doesn't seem that different to me."

    re "Ever since we got here, even before we found out there could only be three clubs, she's been pushing herself without rest to form the squad. I've never seen her fumble during a performance like she did during the opening ceremony. I'm pretty sure a fall like that shouldn't break your ankle, but it's still purple. She refused to suspend practice until she's recovered. It's like all the joy has been sucked out of her. Helping her with the squad feels like the only way I can help."

    "Rei would know best if Mariko's acting odd. Still, there's a high chance this is all coincidence."

    n "I'm sure she appreciates it."

    re "It's such a hopeless feeling watching her like this when I know something's wrong. I keep hoping she'll tell me what's really bothering her, but I'm not sure she knows how to."

    re "Maybe someone was borrowing it from him."

    n "Then they would have asked him first and he'd tell them how to use it..."

    "Why is she acting so defensive?"

    n "Rei, did someone tell you they were borrowing his stuff?"

    re "They didn't have to. He made it perfectly clear that anyone could use his stuff whenever they wanted."

    re "Greatest memory in the world and you always seem to forget that. Besides, there's no rule against going in at night, so technically, it's okay. It beats lying awake in the dorms, that's for sure."

    n "Momo?"

    "No good, she can't hear me. I flick one of the light switches on and off. She jumps, but the minute she sees me a huge smile spreads across her face. I can see her lips moving, but all I hear is the music."

    n "Where's the stereo!? THE STEREO?"

    "Click."

    mh "-keep telling them it's not my fault; the sinks smelled when I got here."

    n "Glad to see you're not trying to avoid me."

    n "Anybody come by the lab?"

    mh "Kazz helped me set up the stereo. That was nice. Especially since I could just give him my club ad in person. The more I can avoid the stairs, the better."

    n "Then someone must have snuck one in from the outside. But how? I thought the teachers confiscated all tech when we got here."

    mh "It's a speaker with bluetooth. It's not that hard to cut it off from the internet. Trust me; Setsuna and Kazz have tried to get me to connect them to the internet multiple times."

    n "Really?"

    mh "Yeah, I'm like; hello, chemistry and technology are two different zones. Oh Momo, you're smart, you must know– No, I only know chemicals."

    n "You think anyone else has one?"

    r "Perish the thought. Please, have a seat. There is something I would like to discuss with you."

    "How does she manage to flip the script so quickly?"

    r "If it is not too much trouble, could you do something about your little friend? Ever since I became class representative, they have been disrupting class with their... jokes."

    "Uitto could care less about who was cleaning erasers and checking attendance logs. However, she's not too keen on people telling her what to do."

    r "It is one thing to whine about my popularity giving me 'unfair' advantages, but it is another to bring my bust size into the conversation. That, and when we were voting for class president, she submitted a rather vulgar drawing of a... phallic-looking thing and asked me to 'suck it'."

    n "Just ignore her."

    r "This kind of behavior is unacceptable. Her actions reflect on you as well, seeing as you are still friends with her."

    n "I know, and I can apologize for her if that's what you want, but talking to her will just make it worse. Either go completely stone faced or get a teacher involved. I can't reign her in like I can with Hiro."

    r "I see... That is disappointing. Well then, I suppose that addresses my concerns, but I believe there was something you wished to discuss?"

    #-Alibi-
    
    r "I overheard what happened during the announcement. How utterly mortifying it must have been to be thrust into the spotlight like that."

    r "Forgive me, I do not have an alibi."

    n "Ahah!"

    "She raises a solitary hand and waits for me to close my mouth."

    r "I cannot offer an alibi for a vague period of time when I am not even sure how it was done in the first place. Everyone was accounted for in my class up until the bell rang. I am certain that remains true for the other classes."

    n "You're positive it wasn't the school model she was running around with?"

    r "Definitely, though she was unable to use it, so I doubt it did her much good. I would be surprised if she held onto it."

    #-Outro-
    
    r "I am sorry I was not more helpful. I have not been around long enough to get a feel for how everyone gets along nowadays. We may have grown up with each other, but a lot can change in two years."

    n "You could help me talk to other people."

    r "And risk my position as neutral observer? I think not. There are too many unknown factors for me to go choosing sides just yet. Quite frankly, your reputation puts you at a disadvantage. Find me after the dust settles and ask who I would invest my time in and you might be pleased with the answer."

    "Is she... rooting for me? If so, she has a strange way of showing it. She packs up her set into an old cigar box with a sigh."

The school was still empty at the time and all the teachers were preparing for first period, so it was just this ominous screeching in the dark hallways. Eventually, we found it was coming from one of the lockers."

    n "I don't remember hearing anything during class."

    nk "Setsuna snuck out during first period after she got the locker combinations from Professor Inukai. She thought it was odd for Mu to have such a noisy ringtone and turned it into the lost and found. Though if it's from the outside, it might have been confiscated."

    n "Did you see her turn it in?"

    nk "Well... no. I stayed in class to cover for her."

    n "It's... I've got things under control. It's fine. I'm surprised that you, you know, care?"

    nk "I'm not heartless. Besides, starting rumors anonymously over the air like that is so irresponsible. I just want you to know not everyone here buys into that witch-hunt mentality."

    t "Nothing really. I guess he's making some extra scratch renting it to Mariko for all her club stuff."

Plus, most of them are too busy tending to their own yards to look over the fence. Not that it makes them bad people, but why bother to perform for an audience that's not watching, y'know?"

    #[BG: Roof]
    
    "Technically, students aren't supposed to come to areas that are under construction. But since the roof's unlocked, some people have been treating it like free game. Dyre is one of those people. He’s dragging old beat-up furniture around a stack of busted palettes, just out of eye-line from the stairs."

    n "What are you doing?"

    "He jolts, then relaxes a bit when he sees me."

    d "Just trying to make the place a little more homey."

    n "But why here? It's basically outdoors."

    d "It's also one of the few places without security cameras. None of the teachers have time to come up here, so it's the perfect spot to set up shop. Metaphorically speaking that is."

    "Dyre's a master at throwing me down rabbit holes when I come looking for something else. I gotta stay focused."

    n "Cool. Look, I actually came to talk to you about something else."

    d "Oooh, let me guess, you're playing detective and want to cross examine me as a witness. Are you going for a Sherlock vibe or Batman?"

    n "This is serious, Dyre."

    #-Alibi-
    
    d "It was the first day of school; there was a bunch of 'get to know you' lectures and other nonsense. Huge waste of time, but everyone saw me in class. There's no way I had the time to set all that up."

    n "You honestly expect me to believe you didn't mess with anyone?"

    d "I didn't say that."

    "He says with a knowing smile, then sighs."

    d "I'm sure you've heard by now, but Kazz brought in a bunch of contraband into the school. It's a bunch of tech stuff, which I wanted to be able to borrow, but he wouldn't shut up about having it. So, I got worried it'd get confiscated or stolen."

    n "What did you do?"

    d "I had Genki hide his Echo in the recording booth when she was dropping off her club request form. I thought it'd be funny to have him freak out for a bit just to have it be right under his nose. Y'know, teach him a lesson before he got his stuff taken away. Turns out I was a little late for that."

    d "Forgive me for doubting, I just didn't want to believe it, even though the truth was so obvious. It's just so disappointing to see how low you've sunk."

    n "The hallways do get really eerie at night."

    ch "Exactly! The lack of artificial light at night is welcoming to the stars, but it shrouds the interior in shadows. Confronting sirens, armed only with a flashlight, I felt my heart stop for a second."

    n "Metaphorical sirens or weird noises?"

    ch "A loud series of noises, around the lockers, I think. I did not pursue the matter further. Though seeing as I have not gotten in trouble for wandering the grounds at night, I do not think it was something I triggered."(+Mysterious Noise)

    "She holds up her left hand with a frown."

    ch "I thought if I was far enough from civilization, I would stop getting messages. They are not as frequent, but today... There is something still trying to use me. I was hoping it was not something that followed me here."

    n "What did it say, if you don't mind me asking?"

    ch "....."
    ch "Attack the crowd and be thrown to the lions."

    n "Is that like 'don't bite the hand that feeds you'?"

    ch "I cannot find any record of it anywhere. The closest thing that comes up is 'Damnatio ad bestias'; death by beasts. It was used as a punishment for instigators of rebellion."

    n "The only thing around here is Taiga's rabbit and pigeons."

    ch "I hope it is nothing. I never know what to do with anonymous messages, especially cryptic ones. All it does is bum people out, but then I wonder if I have a moral obligation to share?"

    n "Well, it's not like your hand predicts the future."

    ch "No. I have no clue who these words come from."

    n "Then don't worry too much about it. You're not a spiritual post office."

    n "Can't you just say no?"

    sh "According to your Treasurer, my refusal would result in the squad putting together uniforms with hot glue and desperation. The last thing they need is to be publicly humiliated by a wardrobe malfunction."

    n "You could start a tab. The teachers should be reimbursing you for anything club related, shouldn't they?"

    sh "I suppose I could get a few contracts going."

    "I can practically hear a cash register go off in his mind."

    n "You haven't heard anything out of the ordinary, have you?"

    sh "There's been a bunch of the generator tests and the like going on at night. I think Mr. Yaguchi hasn't finished installing the school's security system yet. He's been fighting with someone at odd hours."

    n "Does that mean the teachers have access to it?"

    sh "I... I hadn't thought of that before, but you're probably right. They're definitely aware it's here. I mean, Setsuna wouldn't be using things behind the teacher's back, would she?"

    n "If she told them, they may have just forgotten she said anything. That happens a lot. Do you remember if she said something about the stuff?"

    sh "Uhh... Umm... Hmm... Not really, no. Oh wait! She did mention having to talk to them about something in a student's locker and to keep this thing safe for her."

We were supposed to start working on a few singles this weekend, but now.... My point is, it would have been easier for him to record a voice and distort it than generate one.

It feels like, somewhere along the way, we started to abandon those ideals in favor of more 'interesting' role models. Well, look where that's gotten us. We've tolerated awful, toxic people for so long for the sake of entertainment. Bad guys think they get to be heroes just because they tell us they are. Well, no more! I'm going to start over, with new heroes, better heroes. Once they've proven to me they can face injustice head on, they will be welcomed as the true guardians of Valhalla. As for you...

How I long for the days when costumed heroes and villains could battle for dominance in broad daylight. All this sneaking around that has to be done now, just to keep others from intervening, it's demeaning to both of us. One day, there will be a place where real heroes receive the respect they deserve. I wonder; will you ever be worthy of Valhalla, or will my champions steal your places in paradise?
