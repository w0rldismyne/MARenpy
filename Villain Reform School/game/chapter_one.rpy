    #background Nagen’s Room

    kk "Good morning, brotato chips!"
    kk "We’re going to start this school year with a banging opening ceremony in the amphitheater before classes start."
    kk "You got one hour to be up and ready this morning."
    kk "And now, a request from the heart, an original mix by your’s truly to start your day with fighting spirit."

    "I wake up to a song I’ve never heard blaring from an old radio alarm clock. My dorm is uncomfortably cold compared to my bed, but I have to cross the room in order to get to it."

    n "Ugh, where’s the off switch on this thing?"

    "From outside my door, I can hear a rush of activity and a loud bang."

    h "Come on, Nagen, we got to get going if we want to sit together."

    n "Just save me a seat, I’ll meet up with you later."

    j "I tried that, he wouldn’t stop knocking until I opened the door. Do NOT let him in."

    h "If I don’t bug you guys, you’ll just go back to sleep and we’ll be laaate."

    "The banging increases tenfold."

    j "I can’t stop him. His desire to be annoying is too strong."

    h "Open the doooor."

    "I get dressed in record time and slip out before either of my friends can barge in."
    "Jona could only restrain one of Hiro’s arms at a time."
    "It was a valiant effort, but he could be dragged wherever Hiro wanted to go."

    j "Where’s your school stuff?"

    n "In my locker, you nut case."

    j "Sorry."

    h "Come on, Uitto’s saving us a spot with her giraffe legs. We gotta go."

    "I’m hoping that means she’s ready to talk to me, but when we get to the amphitheater, Hiro and Jona immediately sit on either side of her."
    "She’s ignoring me in favor of her own reflection."

    h "You can sit next to me."

    u "Did you get ready together or something? What took you so long?"

    j "I didn’t unpack anything yesterday, sorry."

    u "Next time, just send someone ahead. You know I hate-"

    k "Well well well, your entourage is real after all."

    "Uitto lets out an ugly sigh."

    k "Though I suppose anyone can catch attention with the amount of makeup you put on. Careful not to touch, boys, I heard she doesn’t use sealing spray."

    u "They could care less what I’m wearing, and so should you. This thing you’re doing, it’s not cute. Just go sit down somewhere, these seats are clearly taken."
    
    "She sounds so tired. I’m able to grab her attention and silently ask if she knows this girl from before. Uitto pantomimes a long winded ‘no’. Kitsune, completely oblivious, sits on Jona’s other side."

    k "I could have my fans follow me around all the time, but I was afraid it would make me too unapproachable. People could get the wrong idea and think I’m a stuck up attention hog."
    
    u "People will think a lot of things no matter what you do. I retired so I could stop worrying about my image."
    
    "I can practically hear the wheels turn as Kitsune tries to think of a comeback."

    n "Did you want to watch the assembly with us?"
    
    k "H-hunh?"

    n "Isn’t that why you came here?"

    k "N-no-"

    n "Then why did you sit down?"

    k "I just wanted to talk to Uitto, so-"

    n "What exactly did you want her to say to you?"

    k "....."

    "She gets up quietly and leaves to sit with some other girls."

    u "Thank god. I seriously don’t know what I’d do without you guys."

    h "Why didn’t you just tell her to go away?"

    u "It’s the first day of school. I’m not going to shit on someone’s self esteem for seeking validation, that’d be pointlessly cruel. It just sucks that the one person who wanted to talk to me just wanted to compete against me on stage."

    "We’re interrupted by a comical scale of trumpets as the vice principal bounds on stage. Principal Vivaldi follows close behind in silence."
    
    ik "Welcome, everyone! I hope you all had a good night’s sleep!"

    "No one responds."

    ik "We’ll work on that later. Right now, we wanted to remind you all of a few important school rules before classes start. With a lot of hard work, we hope this place can become like home to you."
    
    v "All students are to remain on campus at all times. That means staying out of the wooded areas surrounding the school. It’s easy to get lost out there and we don’t want anyone to get hurt."
    
    ik "There is a zero tolerance policy toward anyone who commits an act of violence or aggression. Hurting another student, or threatening another student, will result in immediate detention."
    
    v "Finally, no student is allowed in the computer lab without an instructor present. This is to ensure a safe environment. It is also the reason many of your electronic devices were confiscated before entering the dorms. We apologize for any inconveniences this might have caused."
    
    "They didn’t even let me transfer my music onto their cheap burner phone. At least I know my stuff’s safe with Maimai."
    
    ik "Now to end on a happier note, here’s Mariko with some announcements about school clubs."
    
    m "How’s everyone feeling this morning!?"
    
    "We murmur amongst ourselves with one brave soul demanding more sleep."
    
    m "Sleep is for the weak willed! You lot have spent the last year and a half lazing around already. If we’re going to make it through another year, we have to face it with fist full of fire!"
    
    "Her little speech inspires laughter. It may not have been the reaction she wanted, but it’s lifted the mood."
    
    m "A-anyway, the point is, this year could really suck if we don’t have the right attitude going in. Anyone that wants to make a club has to gather at least three interest members before all the faculty advisors get snatched up! So, if you have the guts, you should join the cheer squad."
    
    "She scans the crowd. With each passing moment, her bravado falters. She’s shaking."
    
    m "I-if you do, you can learn how to do this."
    
    "She launches into a backhandspring and lands perfectly on her feet. Without music, her routine feels awkward, and I can tell her nerves are getting to her. It makes it all the more horrifying when something cracks during her floor routine. She fumbles to the ground the minute she tries to stand."
    
    re "Mariko!"
    
    "Her friend rushes out to get her, followed by Mu at a lethargic pace. Mariko tries to shoo them away."
    
    m "I’m fine. God, this is embarrassing."
    
    mu "Stop trying to put weight on it, stupid, there’s a reason you lost some range of motion."
    
    m "I said I’m fine. People are staring."
    
    "Rei swiftly hoists Mariko onto her back."
    
    re "Just humor us and let us take a look at it later."
    
    "She turns to us with a grin."
    
    re "She’s a-okay everyone! If you’re interested in joining, talk to me or Mariko!"
    
    "Mariko buries her face into Rei’s back as she’s carried off stage. Everyone claps out of pity. The second hand embarrassment is palpable. After the assembly, we’re handed our class schedules. I’m stuck with English, P.E., Science, and Proficiency Management. They wanted me to take the Intelligence course, but I can always switch it if I want to."

    "I decide to drop in on Professor Inukai's lecture. Out of all the teachers, he seems the most relaxed and quite frankly, that's what I need right now. Due to the bad weather, class is being held outside. No pencils or paper or devices, just all of us gathered in the first two rows while he tries to focus his ideas into an hour and a half. It’s only the first day of class and there’s already a classroom wide brawl."
    
    h "Nagen, thank god! See, I told you guys there are more people on my side."
    
    m "Cyberdork isn't a Vigor Major, he doesn't count."
    
    h "He does too! Now that we have even teams, we can go back to normal exercises."
    
    m "Group team building is normal! Us girls have always had to pick up the slack around here. The least you could do in return is fall in line."
    
    re "That wasn't the nicest way to put it, but she's right."
    
    "Hiro tears away from me to argue. They’re talking over Professor Inukai the whole time. Completely lost, I gravitate to the two people who aren't up in arms."
    
    n "Shoma, what the hell's going on?"
    
    sh "Well, Mariko and Hiro used to be class reps, but there's not enough students to justify splitting the class by gender. So now they're trying to figure out who gets to be in charge."
    
    n "That's not good."
    
    k "Says you. Every minute they argue is another minute we don't have to do lunges or mindless exercises. This course was always a joke."
    
    "Shoma nods. I feel out of place sitting alongside them. Second guessing my decision, I go to leave, but Hiro calls out to me again."
    
    h "Wait, Nagen, don't go! You gotta stay. I didn't mean to ignore you."
    
    n "Dude, I don't think I belong here, the culture shock alone..."
    
    ik "This isn't going to be a traditional Vigor class. That means no 'teams' or competitions."
    
    m "But, but what about nationals-"
    
    h "You have to be joking!"
    
    k "Then what's the point-"
    
    ik "Now, now guys, I'm sure we can find a way to make everyone happy."
    
    "Mariko and Hiro are glaring daggers at each other with Rei caught in between them. Shoma tunes everyone out and starts sewing small patterns into the hem of his coat. Kitsune looks about as uncomfortable as I feel. All of them are ignoring the teacher."
    
    n "Don't you have a lesson plan or something?"
    
    ik "I have a few ideas, but there's not a lot in the books to base them on. So I don't know-"
    
    h "This is supposed to be the fun 'no homework' class. Y'know, strength training and junk."
    
    m "We're the school's breadwinners. That's why we use class time to prepare for competitions."
    
    ik "There actually won't-"
    
    h "We're all going to get stuck doing the same thing. That's why it should be something fun, not repeating the same flips and twists over and over again!"
    
    m "I never said we had to do cheer."
    
    h "You were thinking it!"
    
    re "Guys, please."
    
    k "What a colossal waste of time. I knew I should have ditched."
    
    ik "Please don't!"
    
    "This is a nightmare. The teacher is in way over his head and clearly doesn't know how to hold a class... Hiro, please forgive me for what I'm about to do."
    
    n "What's going to be on the test?"
    
    "I feel three different people glare at me. Rei watches on with pity in her eyes."
    
    h "Dude!"
    
    sh "Test? What test?"
    
    ik "Excellent questions! Umm, since there's no curriculum guidelines for what I want to do, I'm having to make everything from scratch. So we're kinda playing it by ear."
    
    n "But there is going to be a test?"
    
    h "DUDE!"
    
    ik "Yes. Today we'll be assessing how bad the damage is."
    
    re "Damage!?"
    
    ik "Not like that. Sorry, poor word choice. Umm, you all were chosen by Estella for your unique abilities and were forced to put all your eggs in one basket. And then they sold the baskets like they were their eggs. But they didn't teach you anything about chickens or farming or anything. So you could be making bad eggs right now, and putting them in a basket with a hole in it. Does that make any sense?"
    
    "It was definitely long."
    
    n "What exactly do you want us to do?"
    
    ik "A pretest of sorts. Everyone take a clipboard and pencil. After this, we'll all do ten laps around the field. Me included. No point in making you guys do something I wouldn't do myself."
    
    "With some minor complaints, everyone completes a variety of benign physical exams. The teacher forgot to bring something to write down everyone's results, so I’m put in charge of remembering everyone's numbers. He could have borrowed something from the other students, but I think he was looking for something for me to do. I'm not sure what this is all for, but at least it’s not boring."
    
    ik "Alright, everyone, huddle up!"
    
    "He waits patiently for everyone to calm down."
    
    ik "Competitions, while they make for good advertising for schools, they're hell on your body. I'll text you this week's homework once I've finished crunching the numbers. What is smarter when things are okay?"
    
    Everyone "?????"
    
    "It takes a couple tries, but he finally gets us to yell back."
    
    Everyone "The mind?"
    
    ik "What is smarter when things are going wrong?"
    
    Everyone "...the body?"
    
    ik "We'll keep working on that."
    
    # Vision Class 1 
    # [BG Classroom]
    
    "The first thing that strikes me about the Vision class is how small it is. I thought the courses would be more evenly distributed. There are only four other students and all of them notice me immediately."
    
    j "Nagen, did you get lost?"
    
    ch "Maybe he is a fellow brood parasite."
    
    j "I don't think he's here to lay eggs, Chisei."
    
    i "He better not be."
    
    ch "What I mean is, maybe he has been lying about which major he belongs to."
    
    "Ichita and Jona hone in on me with renewed interest."
    
    i "Oh shoot, can you literally read minds or something?"
    
    ch "And I thought my ability was intrusive, you poor thing."
    
    j "Who's thoughts have you been reading, young man?"
    
    n "N-no, I don't- There's no rule that says I can't be here."
    
    j "So you have tried to read my mind then."
    
    ki "Lay off the new kid, guys, he'll tell us in his own time. You're makin' him uncomfortable by swarmin' him like that."
    
    n "This isn't everyone, is it?"
    
    ki "’Fraid so. There might be a few border-liners who could qualify, but this is more than I was expectin' to be honest."
    
    v "Indeed, it can be quite difficult for people to acknowledge the abnormal nature of their abilities."
    
    "A hush falls over the room as our principal stands where a teacher should be. She gestures for us to sit down. It takes a bit to get everyone to settle. If I knew she'd be teaching, I wouldn't have come. Everyone is waiting for me to sit too. I'll stay for this one class."
    
    v "Coming here took a lot of courage. I've spent a great deal of my life trying to prove to others that my ability is real and there are others like me. The definition of what it means to be a Vision Major is vague by design, to accommodate any new proficiencies that may come along. I am most familiar with ones concerning the dead, but it is my goal for all of you to have better control over your abilities by the end of the year."
    
    n "What makes you qualified to teach? You were a police officer, not a scientist."
    
    v "Ms. Chisei, if you're comfortable with assisting me in this matter, I would appreciate it."
    
    ch "I am not sure what I can do, but okay."
    
    "She joins the teacher at the front of the room."
    
    v "Your left hand is prone to possession; may we borrow it?"
    
    "Chisei goes pale."
    
    ch "I, uh- Who is we?"
    
    "Vivaldi points to her broach."
    
    v "Takahara Kenji, 8th grade, he's agreed to help with our lessons."
    
    ch "Umm... Okay then."
    
    v "I will have Takahara read the last text on your phone, Mr. Tesuta, and have him transcribe it on the board using Chisei's hand. Is that agreeable to you?"
    
    "I check my phone to make sure no one sent me anything embarrassing. The last thing I got was from Uitto confirming she had my new number."
    
    n "Yeah, go ahead."
    
    "I feel my phone vibrate in my pocket. A few seconds later, Chisei’s scribbling on the board."
    
    #-Look at this rad meme-
    
    "She starts drawing a shaky stick figure drawing, her expression changing from confusion to horror."
    
    ch "Umm... is this going to be appropriate for class?"
    
    "I can't help but laugh. Jona grabs my shoulders."
    
    j "Dude, did you plan this?"
    
    n "No, man, Hiro must have sent me something after I checked it."
    
    v "That's enough, Takahara."
    
    "Chisei throws down the chalk, her face flushed."
    
    v "Thank you, Chisei, you may take your seat."
    
    "Jona and I are trying our best not to laugh as Chisei speed-walks to her chair."
    
    ch "That was unnecessary and you know it."
    
    "Vivaldi claps her hands together, silencing the room."
    
    v "As you can see, Vision Proficiencies are difficult to control. With a little patience and introspection, you can prevent them from dominating your life. In due time, your abilities could be refined as a tool you can use. However, it's best to keep our goals small at first. The smallest set back can feel devastating when we're setting our expectations based on how we view other people."
    
    "She turns and draws a small table on the board."
    
    v "Each of your abilities are unique, so it's been difficult to try to design exercises that will apply to all of you. We'll start by taking five minutes to write down all of the things about your power that upsets you."
    
    "She waits patiently for everyone to finish."
    
    v "Now, raise your hand if you wrote less than three things on your list."
    
    "No one raises their hand."
    
    v "Less than eight."
    
    "Still nothing."
    
    v "Eight or more."
    
    "Everyone raises their hand."
    
    v "Even though your abilities deal with the unseen, the effects they have on us are very real. The struggle with negative intrusive thoughts creates an illusion of isolation. As you can see, everyone in this room shares this struggle. You may put down your hands."
    
    "She proceeds to collect examples from the class to put into the first column of her table."
    
    v "Now, look at your own list without the context of your abilities, environment, and so on. If you feel comfortable, you can trade lists with someone to aid in this part of the exercise. I want you to break these items into two categories; things that can change, and things that can't."
    
    "Jona stares at his piece of paper for a long time before taping on my shoulder."
    
    j "Do you, uh, could you trade with me?"

    #Charm Class 1 
    
    "Ms. Yamamoto writes a single thing on the board at the beginning of class before her lecture; a chapter number. When Uitto complained about her class, I was honestly expecting more of a spinstery type of  woman. Instead, the class is taught by a tiny woman looking for the world like a Victorian child up past their bedtime. The minute she opens her mouth, she commands the room."
    
    sa "My lectures are, and only will be, a summary of the most important things you'll need to know. If that is not enough for you, or you're hopelessly confused, read the chapter. If I find you in my office crying about how you don't understand the material, the first thing I'm going to ask is if you read the chapter and you will definitely be instructed to read it again. I would strongly suggest downloading the book now to save yourself the tissue cost. You'll find the link on my faculty page. It will be free for the duration of the course, but if you want to keep it after, you'll have to pay full price. I may not be a sadist, but I am a capitalist at heart. That said, I notice some of you here aren't actually enrolled in the course..."
    
    "She’s staring directly at me as she says this."
    
    sa "Feel free to take a seat closer to the front. If this is how you want to spend your freetime, you might as well get a good seat."
    
    "I refuse to move. Most of us are crowded into the back rows anyway. Like hell I’m going to call attention to myself and put myself where everyone can see me."
    
    sa "Suit yourself."
    
    "She shuffles to a luxurious fainting couch and crawls up onto the fluffy cushion. Once stretched out on the chair, she begins her lecture. I’m surprised how captivating she can be without moving a muscle."
    
    sa "Now then, the reason you're here is up until now, you have excelled using the invisible tools that are social and emotional intelligence. They are skills that anyone can learn, seldom are taught, and are easily abandoned. In spite of that you have, through the years, demonstrated desirable attributes when it comes to communicating with others. You must understand this, because unlike Vigor or Intelligence Majors, the societal validity of your powers are dependent on how others treat you. At this point, success in whatever path you choose is best measured by social prowess. Focus your sights less on the immediate gratification of popularity and more on the ambitions it can serve. World leaders, Nobel Prize winners, CEOs and religious zealots; all were given platforms to make change by other people. Before you can be given your own platforms, you must earn and maintain your influence over others. This week, I want you to study how you interact with others. Really try to pinpoint what behaviors or habits bring you the most success versus the ones that create a wall between you and your target. Take note, especially of the methods you favor and any body language you use. To get a good start, I want you to get into groups of three. Two of you will talk while the third records any patterns of effective communication, like touch or mirroring."
    
    nk "What do you mean mirroring?"
    
    "Ms. Yamamoto points to the blackboard."

    y "Unacceptable. Every-y teacher has the ability to directly contact us. If he was running behind, he shhhhould have told us."

The walls are decorated with a series of screens that vary in shape and size. If I hadn't read the sign on the door, I might have confused him with another student. He can't be that much older than us. He doesn't ever bother to look up from his work as we burst into his office."

    "He continues working on a large hard drive, soldering bits of copper to each other in incomprehensible patterns."
    
    y "Is that all?"
    
    ya "Yeah. I'm not going to assign a bunch of busy work for you to finish just to see if you will. Just stay out of trouble. Go study whatever you want, or don't."
    
    y "Aren't you g-going to... teach us?"
    
    ya "What the hell could I teach you? I'm a metal head engineer, none of that fits under your umbrellas. And y'all too specialized to pick one to study up on. So what am I supposed to do if you ask a question, Google it? You could do that yourself and cut out the middle man."
    
    n "So you're too stupid to teach us."
    
    "He sets down his tools with a grim expression."
    
    ya "Do you know anything about graduate level robotics or thermodynamics?"
    
    n "No."
    
    ya "Are any of you remotely interested in doing it as a career?"
    
    "We all shake our heads."
    
    ya "Then by your definition, Mr. Reverse Psychology, you’re stupid. You don't know something you have no interest in, which makes you stupid because I know it. Does that make it true? You a stupid kid?"
    
    n "N-no!"
    
    ya "Then don't go around comparing intelligence to how much you know like you're collecting Pokémon cards. What good is understanding astrophysics when what makes you happy is making sandwiches? That's what being smart is, figuring out what makes you happy and how to get it."
    
    mu "What would make me happy is a teacher who does his job."
    
    ya "Jesus, college kids would just take the day off when their teacher's absent. Can't you just take a day off?"
    
    y "....."
    
    mh "....."
    
    "No one's answering, which in itself is an answer, I guess. I'm just glad I'm not the only one that feels guilty if I'm not working on something."
    
    kk "Is that gonna be an essay prompt or something?"
    
    ya "Sit down, all of you. I'm going to ask you something, and I'm afraid I already know the answer. How many of you actually want to have a job in the field you were assigned? Not because you were told to or it's easy for you, but because you enjoy it."
    
    "Only Yoku and Mu raise their hands. I can see Momoko thinking about it, but even she isn’t sure."
    
    ya "See, the problem with labeling you kids by what you find easy to understand is you get pigeonholed into a lifestyle that isn't sustainable. As soon as you get to the higher level stuff, it's going to be real work to keep progressing, and that's going to be hell if the end result isn't what makes you happy. If you're just here to make someone else proud of you, then just stop. Stop measuring your self-worth by milestones other people set for you. It's not worth the stress. Trust me."
    
    n "So what, we're just supposed to peak in highschool?"
    
    ya "With as much grace and dignity as you can muster. You only got a few more years of this micro society to go before people stop keeping tabs on you and you gotta worry about real shit. Don't spend it all working your ass off for no reason, have fun for God's sake."
    
    kk "Well that's just depressing."
    
    ya "What's depressing is the army of kids that feel like failures when they remind people they're human. I saw a kid have a breakdown because he got an 89 on one test. It's not like getting A’s ever made him happy either. All demanding perfection ever does is take the joy from your accomplishments. It took me almost a decade to undo what that kind of thinking did to me. The least I can do is put a tourniquet on your bleeding hearts before you completely fall apart in your thirties."
    
    mu "And how do you plan to do that?"
    
    ya "For starters, getting you to do things outside of your Proficiency."
    
    y "Uh... w-what?"
    
    n "You're putting all your self-esteem into one thing. That's a shit idea. God forbid you go deaf, what would you do?"
    
    "Yoku visibly pales."
    
    ya "That's an extreme example, but you get the idea. Having a Proficiency should be a perk, not a life sentence. So we're going to mix it up, each of you is going to pick a random thing and we'll all look into it together. It can literally be anything-"
    
    mh "Cosmetology!"
    
    ya "....."
    
    mh "I, uh, please? It's just a hobby right now, but I'd like to be able to do more than dye extensions if I could."
    
    n "I don't think-"
    
    ya "Perfect, we'll start with that."
    
    mu "...really?"
    
    ya "She had an idea first. If you come up with anything, send it my way and we'll rotate through the year."
    
    "I have no idea what to pick. At least Kazz and Momoko have some idea of what they want to learn. That'll buy me a few weeks."
    
    mu "I don't understand how this is better than studying in the nurse's office."
    
    y "Be-ethoven went deaf a-and continued to compo-ose. As long as I can see and fffeel, I can still write mu-usic."
    
    "This is going to be a long year."
