    n "You're the only human being alive that's comfortable all the time."

    "Everyone crams themselves into my tiny dorm. Because, of course, after only a week of being here, I have the cleanest room."
    "We fight to find an outlet for the TV, opting to balance it on a pile of textbooks so everyone can see."

    h "We'll get the spooky tape out of the way and then have fun, right?"

    u "Of course, no ending the night on a bummer."

    j "No bummers!"

    "I slide the tape in and watch as static peels away to reveal a grainy image of a familiar logo."

    q "Mariko Genki, your bravery during the riots has not gone unnoticed. We would like to give you the support to protect the people you care about most."
    q "All you have to do is help us eliminate a loose end that threatens our operation. You deserve to be recognized as a true hero."
    q "We know you'll make the right choice. Sincerely, Apex of the Karmic Gladiators."

    h "...the Karmic Gladiators sent her? Why!? We were junior heroes for them."

    n "The DVP is busy rounding up Lethe's old pawns, which means this could have come from the members who opposed her or..."

    u "Or her allies that think we turned on them to get out of trouble."

    j "Which we kind of did."

    "None of that explains how they found us, or why they didn't target us directly. And that name..."

    n "I don't remember her ever mentioning an 'Apex'. Did any of you know a hero by that name?"

    u "No, but they could have changed their name after the media turned on Lethe."

    u "It's not uncommon to rebrand after a scandal."

    j "Or maybe it's a title? Like captain or boss?"

    h "A new leader that doesn't like us... that can't be good."

    "The tape sputters and then a curtain displays on the screen. Slowly a girl, suspended by ribbons, is lowered into the frame."
