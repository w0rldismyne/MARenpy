    #Yoku Interrogation
    #[BG: Inner Stage]
    #-Intro-

    y "Careful wh-where you step!"

    "I freeze, foot in the air, with the door to the stage half open. The floor is littered from end to end with carefully overlapped pieces of sheet music. I slowly open the door and find a safe place to stand. Yoku is in the center of it, a little more disheveled than usual."

    n "Are you... okay?"

    y "I- Well, I guess it does look per-ertuburbing to an outsider. Th-there is a method to the madness, I assure you."

    n "I hope so. Is this all from the library?"

    y "It holds a sur-rprising wealth of reference material."

    n "Does the staff know you pulled out all these pages? I'm pretty sure the collections are supposed to be 'intact' while we're here."

    y "....."

    y "They fell out."

    "I’m trying so hard to keep a straight face, but I think he can hear me stifling a laugh."

    y "Clearly you can see I'm preoccupied at the mo-oment. What did you want?"

    #-Alibi-

    y "That morning, I had to report to the classroom early to perform my duties as class representative. It ssseems I'm the only one that wants to come into class twenty minutes early."

    n "You got that right."

    y "Re-reguardless, that morning there was an alarm coming from one of the lockers on the second floor. It was from one of those dubstep/crunk songs that were everywhere befor-re the riots. Very irritating. I asked the council to take care of it. I haven't heard it since."

    "A ringtone maybe?"

    n "What are you doing exactly?"

    "He looks up unamused."

    y "Name on-ne person outside of this room that would have a use for sheet music."

    n "What about Kazz?"

    y "Ha! That wannabe disc jockey couldn't tell B major from G shhharp minor."

    n "...what's the difference?"

    y "There is none, he wouldn't know tha-at either. His idea of writing music is dragging and dr-ropping sound clips. Which is... fffine. I just doubt he'd use these over his machines."

    n "I suppose that's fair." #(+Mysterious noise)
    
    #-CDs-

    n "This is going to sound silly, but would you be able to look at this picture and tell me if there's anything special about how these CDs are organized?"

    y "No."

    n "I was afraid that was the case."

    y "There's no or-rder to them at all. Either that or they were arranged with person-nal taste in mind. Where did you take this picture?"

    n "The AV room."

    y "That's why. Kazz let his friends pick ou-ut what they wanted to hear before he star-rted accepting requests. One of the perks of bein-ng a DJ. It'll be June before I hear any cl-lassical music on the air."

    #-Outro-

    n "Well, thank you for taking time out of... whatever this is to talk to me."

    y "....."

    n "Uh, bye, I guess."

    "I quickly close the door and hear the flutter of papers getting flung into the air."

    y "NOOOOO!"

    n "Sorry, I-"

    "Shit, I better get out of here."

    #Rei Investigation
    #[BG: Amphitheater]

    "Rei might not want to talk to me, but if I want a clear picture, I need to talk to everyone. I find Rei practicing her old floor routine on the outdoor stage. She juggles her plastic sword mechanically, focusing on throwing it as high as she can. Normally she moves with more grace and joy."

    n "Hey, can we talk?"

    "She catches her blade one last time, but refuses to look at me."

    re "Say whatever you want."

    "I think that's as close as I'll get to a yes."

    #-Negotiation-
    g "There will come times when people won't want to talk to you. You'll have one chance to convince them you're worth their time, though Charisma Majors may have more luck."
    
    #[Player Choice]
    #A. What's wrong?
    
    n "You only practice like this when you're upset."

    re "Am I not allowed to be angry?"

    n "That's not what I said. I'm just concerned is all."

    re "Well, I'm glad when you see me face to face, I'm worthy of your concern. For a second there, I thought you'd become a total sociopath."

    n "Rei-"

    re "I don't even know how to fully process this, okay? Just- I'm trying to be mature and not mean, but it's hard. I don't know if I should trust you again. I'll- I'll see you later."

    #(Fail, Rei’s scene is now locked)
    #[Skip past rest of the scene to next event]
    #B. I didn't know...
    
    n "I never meant to hurt you or any of the other kids at school. I'm sorry things turned out like this."

    re "I just feel so stupid. We were all in the same class together for four years. It was like having a second family to me. I constantly worried about how we were going to stay together when we got older only to find you don't think about me at all."

    n "Rei, it's not like that-"

    re "It's not just you. No one here- I think I'm the only one that thought we were all friends."

    "There are definitely people here I could have gone my whole life without seeing again. I don't think there's anything I can say to make this right, but..."

    n "I wanted to keep everyone safe too. That's why I couldn't leave you behind. I really was relieved to see you again, even if you don't want to talk to me again."

    re "I don't want to be mad at you. I really don't. If we're going to stay friends, you can't hide stuff from me. You gotta show me the same trust I showed you."

    "I didn't realize how close Rei felt to everyone. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to have someone this loyal on my side."

    n "The truth is, I'm trying to find who spread the message over the PA system. If you have any ideas, it'd help me a lot."

    #(Success: Unlocks Ask options)
    #-Missing Phone-
    
    re "Yeah, I've seen it. But why? Kazz should have gotten it back by now."

    n "Where did you find it?"

    re "Kitsune brought it to practice looking for the owner. Mariko recognized it right away and said she'd take it back to him. Maybe she hasn't been able to track him down yet; he's been literally all over the place lately..."

    "Still, it wouldn't be hard to leave a note on his dorm or something."

    n "So you didn't see her give it to him?"

    re "No. But I don't see why she'd lie to me. Besides, the two of them are friends, sort of..."

    "Even she doesn't seem totally convinced by that explanation." #(+Baton Pass)
    
    #-Alabi-
    
    re "I've been mostly helping Mariko revive the cheer squad. We've been making posters, working on banners; we even got a spot on the announcements!"

    n "What about flag line? That's why you brought all your armaments, isn't it? There isn't a lot of opportunity for you to dance if you’re a cheerleader."

    re "Most of my stuff's been confiscated. It'll take weeks to make decent prop replacements. Besides, cheer is more accessible to rookies than twirling."

    n "That sounds like Mariko talking, not you."

    re "She needs this more than I need flag line. Anything to make this place feel like a normal school, a place to make new friends, will help her. She's really starting to worry me."

    n "She doesn't seem that different to me."

    re "Ever since we got here, even before we found out there could only be three clubs, she's been pushing herself without rest to form the squad. I've never seen her fumble during a performance like she did during the opening ceremony. I'm pretty sure a fall like that shouldn't break your ankle, but it's still purple. She refused to suspend practice until she's recovered. It's like all the joy has been sucked out of her. Helping her with the squad feels like the only way I can help."

    "Rei would know best if Mariko's acting odd. Still, there's a high chance this is all coincidence."

    n "I'm sure she appreciates it."

    re "It's such a hopeless feeling watching her like this when I know something's wrong. I keep hoping she'll tell me what's really bothering her, but I'm not sure she knows how to."

    n "Don't forget to take care of yourself too. Coming here has been hard for everyone."

    #(+Cheer Ad)
    #-Computer-
    
    re "Kazz had one of those Echo thingies. Wouldn't he be the one to look it up? They were both in his booth after all."

    n "Kazz could have just logged into his account through the computer and programmed new commands through that, but this page is talking about how to use the app. Plus, his phone was missing during that time. It's the only other way to program the thing."

    re "Maybe someone was borrowing it from him."

    n "Then they would have asked him first and he'd tell them how to use it..."

    "Why is she acting so defensive?"

    n "Rei, did someone tell you they were borrowing his stuff?"

    re "They didn't have to. He made it perfectly clear that anyone could use his stuff whenever they wanted."

    "But not without permission. Whoever it was, they must be close to Kazz and Rei." #(+Brag)
    
    #-CD-
    
    re "Between everyone here, that's not a bad collection. Too bad he's not accepting MP3s. I might have some old music on a thumb drive somewhere."

    n "I didn't realize it was a community effort."

    re "Oh yeah. Next semester, I'll be sure to bring a whole bunch of stuff."

    #-Announcement List-
    
    re "We're dead last on the list? That doesn't seem right."

    n "Spots were first come, first serve. Was Mariko in there before the other girls?"

    re "Dyre had pulled her aside wanting to sneak something into the booth. I had assumed that she dropped off the ad when she helped Dyre. Maybe something came up?"

    n "At least you got in on time."

    re "....."
    re "Yeah."

    "She's really not happy about it though."

    #-Outro-
    
    re "After all this drama, I don't think I'll sleep well tonight."

    n "Sleep? What's sleep?"

    re "Nothing too important, I'm sure."

    "To a Vigor Major like her, maybe it's not."

    re "But I should at least try and rest."

    "She hesitates and fumbles with her baton."

    re "You know, some of us like to hang out in the cafe at night. If you came alone, I don't think people would chase you away."

    n "Quite the compelling pitch you got there."

    re "I'm just saying, if you have the energy, maybe you should drop by. It could be a good way to make new friends."

    n "You're asking me to ignore curfew and participate in a ritual B and E? You really are a troublemaker, aren't you?"

    re "Greatest memory in the world and you always seem to forget that. Besides, there's no rule against going in at night, so technically, it's okay. It beats lying awake in the dorms, that's for sure."

    # Currently this portion of the game is now a stretch goal.
    #[IF Vigor < ?]
    #n "I guess that's true. I'll think about it."

    #[Else] 
    n "I'd like to, but I like to sleep more."

    "Vigor Majors can be almost inhuman sometimes."

    re "I'll see you around, Nagen."

    #Momoko Investigation 
    #[BG: Lab]
    #-Intro-
    
    "Momoko's music is so loud I can hear it down the hall. I peer in through the window to make sure she isn't handling any chemicals before opening the door."

    n "Momo?"

    "No good, she can't hear me. I flick one of the light switches on and off. She jumps, but the minute she sees me a huge smile spreads across her face. I can see her lips moving, but all I hear is the music."

    n "Where's the stereo!? THE STEREO?"

    "Click."

    mh "-keep telling them it's not my fault; the sinks smelled when I got here."

    n "Glad to see you're not trying to avoid me."

    mh "Eh, what's the point when you could find me anyway? We're stuck in this fish bowl together for the next four years, why make enemies now?"

    n "...thanks."

    mh "You're welcome! Did you need something?"

    #-Alibi-

    mh "The first day of school... I was here. Every lab has a system for where things go. Now it's my system and I plan to keep it that way. All my time is in my log book."

    n "Anybody come by the lab?"

    mh "Kazz helped me set up the stereo. That was nice. Especially since I could just give him my club ad in person. The more I can avoid the stairs, the better."

    "Right, the skates. It's probably a pain to take them off every time she wants to go to a different floor."

    n "I take it you haven't gone to the third floor then."

    mh "There's nothing for me there."

    #-Computer-
    
    mh "Well, they certainly weren't shopping for one, no one's willing to drive this far for small deliveries. Trust me, the next shipment of lighter fluid won't be here for two months."

    n "Then someone must have snuck one in from the outside. But how? I thought the teachers confiscated all tech when we got here."

    mh "It's a speaker with bluetooth. It's not that hard to cut it off from the internet. Trust me; Setsuna and Kazz have tried to get me to connect them to the internet multiple times."

    n "Really?"

    mh "Yeah, I'm like; hello, chemistry and technology are two different zones. Oh Momo, you're smart, you must know– No, I only know chemicals."

    n "You think anyone else has one?"

    mh "Not likely. Or if they do, they're smart enough to actually hide it. After this, we'll be lucky to keep our school phones. It should show who's logged into it if you ask."(+ID Account)
    
    #-Else-
    
    mh "That doesn't sound out of place, Nagen. Sounds like you're over thinking things again."

    n "There has to be something. I refuse to believe this is a 'perfect crime'."

    #-Outro-
    
    n "...is that beaker supposed to be smoking?"

    mh "Spinach-laced-ridilin, turn off the lights!"

    "She grabs the beaker with a set of tongs and moves it toward the fume hood."

    mh "Not another one- Nagen, the lights!"

    "I plunge the room into darkness and the fire dissipates."

    mh "Now I have to start from scratch! ...maybe that's why the lashes were melting instead of gluing..."

    "I should probably go."

    #Rise Investigation
    #[BG: Courtyard]
    #-Intro-
    
    "I find Rise enjoying a cup of tea in the courtyard."

    n "I hope I'm not interrupting."

    r "Perish the thought. Please, have a seat. There is something I would like to discuss with you."

    "How does she manage to flip the script so quickly?"

    r "If it is not too much trouble, could you do something about your little friend? Ever since I became class representative, they have been disrupting class with their... jokes."

    "Uitto could care less about who was cleaning erasers and checking attendance logs. However, she's not too keen on people telling her what to do."

    r "It is one thing to whine about my popularity giving me 'unfair' advantages, but it is another to bring my bust size into the conversation. That, and when we were voting for class president, she submitted a rather vulgar drawing of a... phallic-looking thing and asked me to 'suck it'."

    n "Just ignore her."

    r "This kind of behavior is unacceptable. Her actions reflect on you as well, seeing as you are still friends with her."

    n "I know, and I can apologize for her if that's what you want, but talking to her will just make it worse. Either go completely stone faced or get a teacher involved. I can't reign her in like I can with Hiro."

    r "I see... That is disappointing. Well then, I suppose that addresses my concerns, but I believe there was something you wished to discuss?"

    #-Alibi-
    
    r "I overheard what happened during the announcement. How utterly mortifying it must have been to be thrust into the spotlight like that."

    n "I didn't ask how you felt about it, I asked if you had anything to do with it."

    r "Forgive me, I do not have an alibi."

    n "Ahah!"

    "She raises a solitary hand and waits for me to close my mouth."

    r "I cannot offer an alibi for a vague period of time when I am not even sure how it was done in the first place. Everyone was accounted for in my class up until the bell rang. I am certain that remains true for the other classes."

    n "Oh."

    r "I am sorry I cannot be of more help. If there is something more specific you would like to ask me about, I would love to help if possible."

    #-Announcement List-
    
    r "I am not a club leader, so I do not have access to the recording booth. I am only a class representitve, not a council member."

    n "Know of anyone who'd have access in your class?"

    r "Someone on the council might, but that is only speculation. You may try asking Nanase or Setsuna if they have access. No one in the Charm Department is a club leader, oddly enough. Everyone seems content to wait until there are more students."

    n "I see, thank you." #(+PA Access)
    
    #-Missing Phone-
    
    r "We have hardly been here a week and people have already started stealing? How distasteful."

    n "You haven't seen anything suspicious, have you?"

    r "That odd girl Kitsune asked if I knew how to get into a phone that had been locked. I assumed she just forgot her password, but none of my tricks seemed to work. I did not know it was possible to have an alternate model, otherwise I would have demanded an upgrade myself."

    n "You're positive it wasn't the school model she was running around with?"

    r "Definitely, though she was unable to use it, so I doubt it did her much good. I would be surprised if she held onto it."

    #-Outro-
    
    r "I am sorry I was not more helpful. I have not been around long enough to get a feel for how everyone gets along nowadays. We may have grown up with each other, but a lot can change in two years."

    n "You could help me talk to other people."

    r "And risk my position as neutral observer? I think not. There are too many unknown factors for me to go choosing sides just yet. Quite frankly, your reputation puts you at a disadvantage. Find me after the dust settles and ask who I would invest my time in and you might be pleased with the answer."

    "Is she... rooting for me? If so, she has a strange way of showing it. She packs up her set into an old cigar box with a sigh."

    r "Do not be too disheartened, Nagen. I know you are smart enough to figure this out."

    "With that, she leaves."

    #Nanase Investigation
    #[BG: Cafe]
    #-Intro-
    
    "Nanase was more than happy to meet with me, but she told me she was working on something at the cafe. I arrive to find various ingredients out, with tinny music playing from a burner phone. Nanase is running around from table to book to fridge covered in what smells like cocoa powder."

    n "Wow, I didn't know we were allowed to use the kitchen."

    nk "Eep! Gah, I mean, hi. Yeah, you can use the cafe during off hours with instructor supervision."

    n "I don't see anyone here."

    "She points to a mounted security camera."

    nk "Mr. Yaguchi's watching from his office, so I don't 'burn the place down'."

    "Creepy. She’s about to dust herself off when she looks up."

    nk "Umm... You don't have any allergies, do you? I didn't think about that before inviting you over."

    n "Eggs and, uhh, maybe marshmallows. Although that might be because I tried to eat a whole bag in under a minute."

    nk "Eggs?"

    "She looks over at a decimated carton on the far left table with obvious disappointment."

    n "I'll be fine as long as I don't eat them."

    nk "Right... Anyways, what did you want to talk about?"

    #-Alibi-
    
    n "I don't remember seeing you during the broadcast. What were you doing?"

    nk "In the morning, before classes, we had our first council meeting. That's when we heard sirens in the hallways. It was so scary! The school was still empty at the time and all the teachers were preparing for first period, so it was just this ominous screeching in the dark hallways. Eventually, we found it was coming from one of the lockers."

    n "I don't remember hearing anything during class."

    nk "Setsuna snuck out during first period after she got the locker combinations from Professor Inukai. She thought it was odd for Mu to have such a noisy ringtone and turned it into the lost and found. Though if it's from the outside, it might have been confiscated."

    n "Did you see her turn it in?"

    nk "Well... no. I stayed in class to cover for her."

    n "Does she have everyone's locker combinations or just Mu's?"

    nk "Everyone's... we couldn't tell who's locker it was from the outside, it wasn't decorated or anything." #(+Locker Combo)
    
    #-Announcement List-
    
    nk "Kietsu's the one who's been handling club requests. Though it seems like he's approving anyone who applies. I'm not even sure there's enough interest to maintain four clubs at this school. We barely have enough for a functioning student council."

    n "You wouldn't happen to know who the club leaders are, would you?"

    nk "No, sorry."

    #-Other-
    
    nk "Well, it isn't odd that those things would be in the PA room. I don't see anything... incriminating about it."

    "She probably thinks I'm being paranoid."

    #-Outro-
    
    nk "Umm... are you doing okay? "

    n "Hunh?"

    nk "I mean, that message over the PA was really scary. I can't imagine what it would feel like to get bullied the first day of school."

    n "It's... I've got things under control. It's fine. I'm surprised that you, you know, care?"

    nk "I'm not heartless. Besides, starting rumors anonymously over the air like that is so irresponsible. I just want you to know not everyone here buys into that witch-hunt mentality."

    n "Uhh... thanks."

    nk "If there's anything else I can do to help you, just let me know."

    n "Sure."

    "It's so weird to think the announcement pissed off people who weren't even involved. I wonder if there are others who felt threatened by it."

    #Kietsu Investigation
    #[BG: Office]
    
    "I find Kietsu buried under a pile of paperwork. Everything is sorted into color-coded piles, but chaotically so. Every few seconds, he pauses to write something on a stray sticky note."

    n "Hey, do you have a minute?"

    "No response. He must really be in the zone. I turn to leave, but opening the door catches his attention."

    ki "Sorry man, didn't mean to ignore you. Have a seat. I need a break from this mess anyway."

    n "What is all this?"

    ki "...I'm not exactly sure. Some of it's stuff to help the teachers, some of it's fundraisin’ ideas, some of it's random stuff we could do. Nanase's the one who organized them for me, but then the piles hit the floor... It's gonna take a fortnight to sift through. Anyway, what can I do for you?"

    #-Announcement List-
    
    n "You were in charge of approving the club ads, weren't you?"

    ki "Hmm... yeah, I guess I was. I didn't read any of them though. I figured if there was anything y'know, bad, Kazz would catch it before readin’ it. Anyone who wanted to run a club I let borrow the AV room key so they could drop off their ad. At least this way, everyone gets a fair shot at gatherin’ members to get their club approved by the teachers."

    n "Wait, you just let anyone go in the AV room?"

    ki "Only people who really wanted to get a club ad in before the first mornin’ announcements. Seriously, some kids are really intense when it comes to after school activities."

    n "Who all did you give the key to?"

    ki "Chisei, at like, 6AM. And then Mariko twenty minutes later. After that, Kazz took the key so he could go straight to the AV room after first period."

    n "Was anyone else with them when they asked for the key?"

    ki "Not that I could see."

    "Kazz doesn't seem like the type to let people in. It might be a good idea to check with the others."(+PA Access)
    
    #-Other-
    
    ki "It'd be weirder if that wasn't there, wouldn't it?"

    n "I guess..."

    ki "Kazz knows that booth better than me. If something went missin’, then he'd know."

    #-Alibi-
    
    n "What were you doing before the broadcast?"

    ki "Broadcast?"

    n "....."

    n "The broadcast; creepy robot voice saying the school is dangerous and my friends should get expelled. It went off after first period."

    ki "Is that what people are talkin’ about? I could barely hear it at the time. That really blows, man. No wonder you're freakin’ out."

    n "I- Umm... I wouldn't say I'm 'freaking out'. I'm just, really curious what people were up to before that happened."

    "There's really no way to question people about this without sounding paranoid as all get out. Doesn't seem to bother him much though."

    ki "I was in class... before that was the council meeting... nothing seemed out of the ordinary."

    n "What happened during the meeting?"

    ki "Setsuna rejected all my proposals and stormed off. Nanase went to follow her in a panic. It seems like that's normal for both of them though."

    n "I see."

    #-Outro-
    
    ki "Sorry I can't help you out more, but if I want to be able to host any school events, I need to have a fool-proof plan of attack against the penny-pinchin’ treasurer. If anything’ about what happened makes it through the student council, I'll let you know."

    n "Thanks."

    ki "And Nagen?"

    n "Yeah?"

    ki "Don't let this whole thing dominate your head space. If people find out one message is enough to send you in a tailspin, more people will try to use it to mess with you. It can be really easy to let fear cloud your judgment."

    "For a second there, he sounded so grown up. But just as quickly, his gaze wanders and he starts fretting over the disorganized piles on his desk."

    ki "Things will get easier once we get everythin’ under control."

    n "...we?"

    ki "Hnh? Oh yeah. You're the one who sent in a council application form, right? That means we could be workin’ together for the rest of the year."

    n "Yeah. That's true."

    "I guess they really do need all the help they can get. Still, it's nice to know not everyone thinks I'm a monster on sight."

    n "I'll talk to you later."

    "There's still more people I have to see."

    #Taiga Investigation
    #[BG: Courtyard]
    #-Intro-
    
    "I find Taiga doing stretches in the courtyard. Next to him is a wide pen for his rabbits to enjoy the fresh air. It's strange to see him this awake."

    t "....."
    t "How long have you been watching me?"

Plus, most of them are too busy tending to their own yards to look over the fence. Not that it makes them bad people, but why bother to perform for an audience that's not watching, y'know?"

He’s dragging old beat-up furniture around a stack of busted palettes, just out of eye-line from the stairs."

    n "What are you doing?"

    "He jolts, then relaxes a bit when he sees me."

    d "Just trying to make the place a little more homey."

    n "But why here? It's basically outdoors."

    d "It's also one of the few places without security cameras. None of the teachers have time to come up here, so it's the perfect spot to set up shop. Metaphorically speaking that is."

    "Dyre's a master at throwing me down rabbit holes when I come looking for something else. I gotta stay focused."

    n "Cool. Look, I actually came to talk to you about something else."

    d "Oooh, let me guess, you're playing detective and want to cross examine me as a witness. Are you going for a Sherlock vibe or Batman?"

    #-Alibi-

    n "You honestly expect me to believe you didn't mess with anyone?"

    d "I didn't say that."

    "He says with a knowing smile, then sighs."

    d "I'm sure you've heard by now, but Kazz brought in a bunch of contraband into the school. It's a bunch of tech stuff, which I wanted to be able to borrow, but he wouldn't shut up about having it. So, I got worried it'd get confiscated or stolen."

    n "What did you do?"

    d "I had Genki hide his Echo in the recording booth when she was dropping off her club request form. I thought it'd be funny to have him freak out for a bit just to have it be right under his nose. Y'know, teach him a lesson before he got his stuff taken away. Turns out I was a little late for that."

    n "The hallways do get really eerie at night."

    ch "Exactly! The lack of artificial light at night is welcoming to the stars, but it shrouds the interior in shadows. Confronting sirens, armed only with a flashlight, I felt my heart stop for a second."

    n "Metaphorical sirens or weird noises?"

    ch "A loud series of noises, around the lockers, I think. I did not pursue the matter further. Though seeing as I have not gotten in trouble for wandering the grounds at night, I do not think it was something I triggered."(+Mysterious Noise)

    "She holds up her left hand with a frown."

    ch "I thought if I was far enough from civilization, I would stop getting messages. They are not as frequent, but today... There is something still trying to use me. I was hoping it was not something that followed me here."

    ch "....."

    n "Is that like 'don't bite the hand that feeds you'?"

    n "The only thing around here is Taiga's rabbit and pigeons."

    ch "I hope it is nothing. I never know what to do with anonymous messages, especially cryptic ones. All it does is bum people out, but then I wonder if I have a moral obligation to share?"

    n "Well, it's not like your hand predicts the future."

    n "Can't you just say no?"

    sh "According to your Treasurer, my refusal would result in the squad putting together uniforms with hot glue and desperation. The last thing they need is to be publicly humiliated by a wardrobe malfunction."

    n "You could start a tab. The teachers should be reimbursing you for anything club related, shouldn't they?"

    sh "I suppose I could get a few contracts going."

    "I can practically hear a cash register go off in his mind."

    n "You haven't heard anything out of the ordinary, have you?"

    n "Does that mean the teachers have access to it?"

    sh "I... I hadn't thought of that before, but you're probably right. They're definitely aware it's here. I mean, Setsuna wouldn't be using things behind the teacher's back, would she?"

    n "If she told them, they may have just forgotten she said anything. That happens a lot. Do you remember if she said something about the stuff?"

    sh "Uhh... Umm... Hmm... Not really, no. Oh wait! She did mention having to talk to them about something in a student's locker and to keep this thing safe for her."

    n "....."

    k "You wouldn't happen to have Tylenol or something, would you?"

    n "No. Shouldn't you go to the nurse's office for something like that?"

    k "Absolutely no, I'd have to walk."

    "She kicks at a pair of abandoned heels."

    k "And I really don't want to deal with all of Mu's nosey questions."

    n "That's fair."

    k "Would you be able to go get me some? Please?"

    "There's no way Mu would hand me meds unless he was there to watch me take it. But Jona usually carries all kinds of stuff in his pockets."

    n "I might know where to get some, but afterward I need to talk to you."

    k "Yes, anything. You're literally a life saver."

    "I return with a ziplock bag and a 'no questions asked' debt to Jona. Kitsune accepts it with abundant appreciation."

    k "I seriously underestimated how much endurance it takes to look this good everyday."

    "Yeah, she's definitely feeling better."

    k "Well, I did say I would owe you, so what exactly were you hoping to talk to me about?"

    #-Microphone-
    
    k "It's a shame, isn't it? There's no recording equipment available to the students. But what you heard didn't use any of that."

    n "How can you tell?"

    k "When you have a telephone chain of recording devices and speakers, there will always be feedback or artifacts. Something was set up to play the clip directly into the mic, live. There's no way that was a person speaking either. Every person has a specific rhythm they speak in, but computers are flat. Something that unnatural sounding had to be computer generated."

    n "Why would that matter?"

    k "Everything seems to have been done using Kazz's stuff, but he has ways of recording audio with the stuff he brought in. We were supposed to start working on a few singles this weekend, but now.... My point is, it would have been easier for him to record a voice and distort it than generate one. I think someone is trying to frame him."

    "It wouldn't be hard to tip an anxious person like him over the edge as a distraction. But I can't ignore that Kitsune has a personal reason for wanting to keep him out of trouble."(+Alexa Voice)

    k "I should have known that was his, he's the only person I know who's snuck in tech they shouldn't have. I just didn't take him for a skull kind of guy."

    n "So you have seen it."

    k "Ichita and I found it near the dorms. I told him I was going to take it to the lost and found, but... I didn't want to get someone in trouble for losing something they cared about. So I went to find someone on the council when I ran into Rei and Mariko."

    "She bites her lip."

    k "Mariko recognized it, so I gave it to her. You know she's got the whole goth thing going on, it seemed like it fit her personality, she even knew the passcode. I just didn't think to question it."

    n "But Kazz still hasn't found it. So she didn't give it back to him."

    k "Do you think she stole it? They're pretty close, why would she do something like that to him? You don't think she's just pretending to be friends with him so she can take advantage of him? That would be horrible."

    n "Honestly, I couldn't say."

    k "He already has a hard time opening up to people. If that's true, he'll be devastated."

    "Maybe she knows something about him I don't. As far as I can tell, he's one of the most trusting people here."

    "Why do I get the feeling I'm going to regret asking this?"

    n "What were you doing before classes started on the first day of school?"

    k "Moi? Well, I had planned to make use of our isolation by working on my craft, but alas, I'm not a born seamstress. Actually, none of the dresses I tried to make looked wearable. If Uitto saw me held together with safety pins, I'd never be able to live with myself."

    "I don't think she'd care."

    n "You tried making your own clothes?"

    k "I have a very specific image of what I want to look like. Unfortunately, my skills aren't up to speed with my taste level. Shoma caught me trying to dispose of the evidence and was kind enough to salvage my mess into this. Though I wish he'd just teach me instead of forcing me to pay him every time I need a new outfit. I can't afford to be indebted to someone like that."

    k "What do you think they're going to do to Hiro?"

    n "I'm not letting anything happen to him. You don't need to worry about that."

    k "I can't help but worry. It's one thing to humiliate someone, but to be so deliberately vague... I've seen girls pushed down stairs for not dropping out of choir competitions before. This could get really ugly. He's too trusting."

    n "Yeah... I'm glad someone else here is taking this seriously. A lot of people have been making me feel like I'm being paranoid."

    k "People generally send threats hoping fear will be enough to get them what they want. If they really wanted to fight, they wouldn't have warned you guys at all. Instead, all of you stayed."

    n "You think they're trying to get all of us to drop out of the school?"

    k "They said all of your names; I think it's safe to say they want to use Hiro to scare you guys as well. And if the scare tactics aren't working, how else are they going to guarantee Hiro won't come to class?"

    "A number of things come to mind, none of them good."

    k "If I were you, I wouldn't be investigating on your own like this. Especially when meeting people in places without witnesses."

    "She carefully puts on her heels and sighs."

    k "I always forget how sheltered you were."

    "She hobbles out of the room and leaves me behind. I’m the only one left in the library."

    #[BG: Courtyard]

    mu "I thought vampires hated the sunlight."

    n "You would know. Pretty sure your whole squad's allergic to sleeping."

    mu "Don't remind me."

    "Hit a little too close to home I see."

    mu "I'm on break right now, but if it's an emergency-"

    n "I'm not here for health reasons. I just wanted to ask you some questions about what's been going on at the school."

    "He gestures at the seat across from him. I take that as an open invitation."

    mu "Just questions. If you turn this into a cross examination, I'm leaving."

    n "I suppose that's fair."

    mu "I feel bad for Kazz, I really do, but bringing stuff you aren't supposed to have doesn't make you cool. He kept showing off and trying to impress people with all the stuff he managed to slip by the teachers. There's only so much second hand cringe we could take, so Dyre had the bright idea to give him a scare by swiping his Echo. That was before we realized he lost his phone."

    n "Does he know you guys took something from him as well?"

    mu "All they did was sneak it into his PA booth without telling him. Honestly, I'm surprised it took him so long to notice they moved it. Even then, we had to tell him where it was."

    n "'They' not 'we'?"

    mu "I'm just an idea man. I didn't have a clue how to get in the booth without raising suspicion. You've seen how guarded he is about it. I thought it'd be better to just hide it in a locker, but Dyre and Mariko were determined to hide it right under his nose."

    n "When did all this happen?"

    mu "During move-in day."

    "So the Echo was already in the booth by the time club submissions were open. That means anyone who could get in the booth would have access to it."(+Brag) (+Prank)

    n "Really?"

    mu "Yeah, funny how that works. It's been nice to talk to other people, even if everyone's a little high strung. What a way to start the year though. I thought the wrestling team's hazing was bad."

    n "I don't think the goblin on the PA system was hazing us."

    mu "Looks like someone was trying to figure out how to get Kazz's Echo to learn new commands."

    "He shakes his head."

    mu "Kazz has his set up to do a bunch of things. They probably just wanted it to spook him when he said something or change what name it responded to."

    "He's absolutely covering for someone. I don't think he'll tell me who, but he might be able to confirm something else."

    n "You just hope that the conclusion you came to is wrong. Funny you won't share it with me."

    mu "It's not you I'm worried about. It's the little murder hobos that you hang out with that has me worried. At the end of the day, my job is to keep people from hurting themselves. The last thing we need is a fight."

    n "What are you doing down there?"

    "He rolls onto his back and sits up. His hair is a mess and his hat got lost in the folds of his hoodie."

    kk "Dude, I'm so fucking dead. You haven't seen a camera with paint splattered on it, have you?"

    n "No man, I haven't."

    kk "I'm sorry brogati, I know I probably sound like a broken record by now. It's just- the longer my stuff's missing, the more I'm freaking out about who could have gone through it. I didn't even think to back anything up. What if it's dead!? Shit, I don't know which is worse, broken or stolen?"

    n "Woah there, you need to breathe. It's not the end of the world."

    kk "I'm going to be the idiot that got expelled on the first week of school. If they take me, give Dyre the rest of my stuff. He'll know where to find it."

    n "Hunh?"

    kk "Given our previous relationship, it's overwhelmingly likely you came here with an accusation of some kind. Circumstances have been tailored to paint me as the villain. And this was supposed to be the year everyone finally thought I was cool!"

    "I guess I'm not the only one struggling to rebuild their image."

    n "I'm trying not to jump to conclusions, but I do need to talk to you about everything that's happened. Especially if you think someone's setting you up."

    kk "I didn't say that..."

    "He's the one who brought up getting framed though."

    n "Mu's."

    "Everything's a mess right now, but the bottom line is Kazz's 'friends' were the ones running off with his stuff."

After the disaster in Guwon, I thought here's my chance to be the cool kid for once. If I'm friends with everybody, then going to school here will seem less scary. All it did was get my stuff stolen."

    kk "And that's a good thing because???"

    n "Well, then it's one mega-asshole making everyone miserable instead of everyone being two-faced and stealing from people."

    kk "It just sucks because without my phone, I can't log into anything. Everything's been on auto login for years, so I don't remember any of my passwords. I don't even have a phone lock because it'd been another blob of info I'd forget."

The things she writes now are total downers. Momoko just wrote what her club was with instructions to 'adlib'. Still, I'm glad it was only those three."

    n "You don't think they shared the key with anyone else, do you?"

    kk "Some of them are mine. I tried to keep everyone's stuff separated so I could give them back at the end of the year. Mariko had a bunch of 90s grunge rock and Mu collects stuff from pop artists I never heard of. If you have anything, feel free to pitch it in. Just hand it to me directly. Dyre'll just try to slip in his hyperpop remixes of kid's songs into your gel cases if they get to him first."

    m "So what if I was? He told a lot of people about that stuff. I mean, even you know about it. Besides, that has nothing to do with me. There isn't any proof the stuff that was in there belonged to Kazz in the first place."

    #[3A: Prank]

    m "You don't know that."

    n "Are you saying he lied? I wouldn't be surprised, but if he hears you've been telling people otherwise-"

    m "Don't! He told a few people about doing that, but we couldn't go through with it."

    n "Then do you still have it?"

    m "N-no. I hid it somewhere else. Like I said, none of us could get in."

    m "So? Nagen, are you seriously accusing me of manipulating my classmates?"

    n "No, I think you just saw an opportunity and took it. I'm sure I'm not the only one who suspects as much. They're just too nice to confront you about it."

    m "An opportunity to do what? Quit dancing around the subject and spit it out."

    n "You're the one who called out a challenge to Hiro on the PA system. You borrowed the keys from Kietsu and returned them after the message played. You're the only one who could have done it."

    n "Right, but I could check the Echo that hasn't been confiscated and see if he's logged into that one."

    m "You wouldn't."

    n "It'd be a quick walk to Shoma's workshop is all. You had access to Kazz's whole setup and he gave you just enough information that you could use it."

I took it there after I talked with Kitsune, which was before the announcement went off. So, yeah, you can't prove a thing."

    "She's ringing her hands quite a bit. Doesn't seem like she has anything to say to that."

    n "Kazz has been having people call it for days. Funnily enough, no one could hear it anymore after the announcements, no matter how many times it was called. It might have been given to the teachers then, but not before it could be used."
