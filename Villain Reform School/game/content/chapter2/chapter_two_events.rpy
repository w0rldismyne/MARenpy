    #Day 1 Event 1

    #[BG: Dorm]

    kk "Good morning, brotatos, and welcome to another amazing week at school. To get you in the mood, a request from the heart, it's Innuendo by Queen."

    "Leave it to Kazz to blast a whole rock opera first thing in the morning. I wish I could be that chipper this early."
    "Unfortunately, I'm more akin to a zombie. Even a full weekend of rest wasn't enough to feel refreshed. Especially after what happened last week."
    "Mariko... she got her instructions from someone. Could it be someone at this school? It'd make the most sense, but where could they be hiding?"
    "I roll over and check the time. If I don't get up soon, I'll be late for my first unofficial student council meeting."

    #[BG: Stuco Dim]

    "The lights aren't on. Am I that late? I can't imagine we'd have that much to discuss. As I'm about to leave, the door swings open."

    nk "Wait, don't leave!"

    s "I told you turning off the lights was too much."

    ki "I got it, hold on."

    "The lights flicker on and I can see the members in homemade party hats with a plate of brownies in front of them."

    n "What on Earth-"

    ki "Surprise! We wanted to welcome you to the student council properly this time."

    n "This is all for me?"

    s "It's for all of us."

    ki "We're going to be workin' as a team startin' today. The first week of school was garbage for a lot of people, so we gotta think of ways to raise morale. Which reminds me; Setsuna, isn't there somethin' you'd like to say to Nagen?"

    s "Don't screw this up."

    nk "I told you she wasn't going to apologize."

    s "I don't-"

    "She sighs, almost in a defeated way."

    s "I thought I was smarter than you and I let my ego get in the way when you offered to help. I should have trusted you more. If I had, maybe we could've protected Hiro together."

    "That wasn't really an apology, but I'll take a healthy dose of humility."

    ki "Close enough. Now, I went ahead and asked the class representatives to join us in decidin' what to do to cheer everyone up. If we can get everyone to help out, we could host a huge party."

    n "A party? That's not a horrible idea, but it will be a lot of work."

    s "My thoughts exactly."

    nk "I think as long as we keep expectations low, we could pull it off without disappointing anyone."

    "She and Kietsu look at me with hope in their eyes."

    n "If we can convince all the classes to help out, then we'll be able to do it."

    ki "YES! I like those odds."

    "The teachers have been making them do office work, like labeling drawers. I guess this is the first time they've been able to do stuff for the students."
    "After we finish the menial tasks we were given, the class reps come to meet with us, each speaking for their respective Major."
    "Rise, Yoku, and Ichita didn't really surprise me, but I'm shocked to see Hiro here after everything that happened."

    r "It is almost like deja vu, though thankfully Jona has been replaced with a more pleasing candidate."

    i "I didn't have much of a choice. With half the class in the club positions, I was the only one free."

    y "....."

    "He practically has his back to her. Was it something she said?"

    h "Anyway, what'd you want to ask us, dude?"

    ki "We finally got enough approval to do the thing!"

    i "Man, I thought they'd never let us hold a dance."

    n "A dance?! Now wait a minute-"

    r "A homecoming dance that honors all of the students, what a clever idea."

    h "Nagen didn't say anything about a homecoming dance. You just said that so you could win a popularity contest."

    y "....."

    r "...I suppose it would be unfair for council members to win prizes at a party they planned."

    s "Prizes? We don't have the funds for decorations, let alone 'prizes'."

    i "But you gotta have a king and queen of a school dance. Everyone expects it, it's tradition or whatever. We should be able to be voted for too."

    n "Like I was trying to say earlier-"

    h "I guess it'd be fair if that's the case. But do we have a theme?"

    ki "Masquerades are pretty easy."

    r "Oh excellent, I should have something from home that would work. We could offer discounts to couples too."

    n "Not everyone has money-"

    i "Door charge could be snacks then. Or stuff that makes the party better."

    h "That's a good idea!"

    r "Then how about Monday night? That should be enough time to prepare without alienating the chronic procrastinators in our class."

    i "Then it's settled!"

    r "We can figure out the details together later; class is about to start."

    h "Great ideas, guys. This is going to be tons of fun."

    "Rise, Hiro, and Ichita leave the room chattering amongst themselves, leaving the rest of us with the aftermath."

    nk "...What just happened?"

    y "Y-you invited the most ta-talkative and competitive kids into your office to hear their opinions. You are only going to hear their opinions if they're all in th-the same room. You're lucky they all agreed with each other."

    s "This is a disaster. There's no way we can afford to plan a masquerade and whatever else they want to add on before lunch."

    nk "Eight days isn't much time to plan either."

    n "No, we can make this work. We just have to take control of the situation before it gets out of hand."

    ki "That's the spirit! Come on, guys, this is going to be fun."

    nk "Right... fun."

    y "May I have a brownie?"

    "Right, this was supposed to be our welcome party. Some first day this turned out to be."

    n "Sure, knock yourself out."

    #[BG: (tba)]

    "After class, I go to meet up with Uitto and the others, hoping they might have some ideas. Unfortunately..."

    j "Nagen, did I have my sketchbook with me when we stayed in your room?"

    n "No? Why, what happened to it?"

    j "I can't find it! I've already looked everywhere, I dumped out my backpack three times."

    u "We're trying to figure out when the last time he had it was."

    "Usually, it's on his person at all times. It's like another limb or something. But I know for sure he didn't bring it with him to my room, which means the last time I saw it on him was..."

    n "When we realized Hiro was missing. We were all freaking out at the time. Jona, do you remember packing it up before we tried looking for him?"

    j "No... there was nothing at our spot either. Someone turned my pens into the teachers, but my sketchbook is gone. This is bad. I wanted to get extras, but nooo, I just had to make room for a second blanket."

    h "Can't you just draw on other paper?"

    "Oh, if looks could kill, Hiro would be a deadman right now."

    j "It has to be the right paper! If the grain's too smooth or the page is too thin, it'll be garbage. The pages need to be in order. I can't draw without it, but if I don't draw, I'll start stimming in class and everyone will stare."

    h "We get it. This is one of those weird Jona things. We'll try our best to find it, but you might have to get a new one."

    j "Aggh!!!"

    n "It's just going to be one of those weeks, isn't it?"

    u "Why, what happened to you?"

    n "The student council went from planning a small party to well, this."

    "I hand her a three page list of all the class rep's requests. A lot of them contradict each other or are impossible."

    u "How on Earth?"

    h "Oooh, that reminds me, wouldn't it be cool if we could get everyone's masks to light up?"

    u "Nevermind, I think I get the picture."

    n "Well, you're the one with the gift of gab, think you could get even half of the stuff on the list?"

    u "We can at least get everyone looking the part, though we'd be owing Shoma big time. The rest... I'll see what I can do. I don't see why you'd need me for this, though."

    "She hands the list to Hiro, who starts scribbling stuff down in the margins."

    n "You don't think you can convince Ms. Sato to lend us some of her resources?"

    u "Are you serious? Negotiating with her counts as my final exam."

    n "Does that mean you can't do it? In a pinch, I could ask Dyre to try."

    u "Don't bother. I can see what all I can get before the dance."

    j "Dance? That reminds me, someone left this on my desk this morning."

    u "Shut up, don't tell me you got a love letter?"

    j "I'm not sure. I was going to ask you guys before I got my hopes up."

    "He hands it to me and I must say, it isn't a love note. Someone used clippings to cobble together the following:"

    #Image?
    "I will strike during the dance."

    h "You got a threat letter too... Why didn't you show us this first instead of complaining about your sketchpad?"

    j "Because getting nasty notes isn't that unusual for me."

    u "You should see what people wrote about him in the girl's bathroom. Pretty vile stuff, and that was when we were kids. This is pretty tame by comparison."

    h "Still, it hasn't even been a week since someone challenged me. This could be the same."

    n "Whoever it is, they're trying harder not to get caught."

    u "But why bother with a warning at all? At least last time there was a bounty, but this is deliberately vague."

    n "No point in riling everyone up at the school now. If anyone was going to help them, they would've by now."

    u "I guess, it's just... odd."

    #Ch2 Investigation

    #[BG: Tba]

    "I don't have much to go off of other than this note. Maybe the culprit left us a clue?"
    g "Click on items to see if they lead to any clues."

    "Paper: It's thicker than normal paper, but it's too white to be cardstock. (+Sketchbook Paper)"

    n "Jona, what color is your sketchbook paper?"

    j "White, wh- No. They wouldn't, no one would do something so cruel to something so innocent."

    h "It's just paper, dude."

    j "....."

    "He's not listening, or maybe he's in denial. Still, it could be a page from his stolen sketchbook."

    "Largest Letter: *Something's sticking out from behind the letter. If I peel it back some... (+Red Hair)"

    u "What are you looking for, a secret code?"

    n "A hair."

    u "Ew, Nagen, leave that alone."

    h "What color is it?"

    n "Reddish? It's hard to tell when there's only one."

    j "Then we know exactly who sent it."

    "Not exactly, but it's a start."

    "'N' in Dacne: It's misspelled. Furthermore, it looks like these were all cut out from the same issue of a magazine. (+Magazine Clippings +Dance)"

    u "You're not thinking of correcting the note, are you?"

    n "...No."

    h "What's there to correct?"

    u "Oh, Hiro. Look again, look real hard."

    h "...I don't see it."

    j "The mind is a fascinating place."

    h "Please just tell me what it is or it's gonna bug me all day."

    "Pink Streak: *What the hell is this? Uitto takes it from my hands and squints. (+Nail Polish Chip)"

    u "Anyone got some glue or... wait, bingo!"

    "She points to a small pink triangle near the first letter."

    n "I don't get it, what am I looking at?"

    u "Nail polish, dear Watson. If you get a chemical like hand sanitizer on cheap nail polish, it goes all soft again and can rub off on stuff."

    h "Pfft-"

    u "Oh quit it, you know I didn't mean it like that!"

    h "Yeah, that's what makes it really funny."

    u "Next time, I'll use scientific terms and you can stare at us blankly, how about that?"

    j ".....?"

    n "Don't ask."

    "It's not a lot to go on, but at least we have somewhere to start."

    #[Return to Main Branch]

    j "It's nice of you guys to worry, but honestly, I'd rather get my sketchbook back than bug other people about this. Besides, you've got a lot to do for the masquerade ball."

    n "It's not a ball! Where are you people getting that idea from?"

    h "Jona has a point, though. You're the student council president. If everyone busts their asses getting ready and it sucks, people are going to wonder what you were doing."

    g "During the investigation, you can ask fellow students to help with preparations for the dance. You know what they say in Colorado... \"One awesome party can fix everything.\""

    n "No. Why, are you getting hounded again?"

    ki "Not exactly."

    #[CG: Poster saying "Nothing matters. Waste time with us. ^ NC]

    n "That's mildly concerning."

    ki "There's no rules prohibitin' students from gatherin', but with everythin' goin' on, I agree it's concernin'. I just wanted to make sure it wasn't a side project before I sent Setsu to investigate."

    h "Investigate what? You just said it's not against the rules to do this."

    ki "It's not against the school's rules. I've been at enough places to know crap like this can lead to kids gettin' hazed to death or worse. There's a reason they didn't come to us or the teachers about this and frankly, there's no way for the four of them to watch everyone at all times."

    h "You're just going to scare people if you go around spying on people like this."

    n "People are already scared, Hiro. We're trying to make things better, but if the party doesn't work..."

    ki "The council will rise to the top of the food chain through fear if necessary. It may be the only way to keep dangerous people out of power. I really hope it won't come to that."

    n "Agreed. Let me know if Setsuna finds anything."

    "Hiro pulls me aside, oddly serious."

    #[IF Hero]

    h "All this coming after Jona's threat letter... it might be a distraction."

    n "They were with me all morning, I highly doubt they'd mislead me after begging me to join."

    h "That's not what I meant. Between the dance, the letter, and this, I think someone's trying to spread the council so thin that everything will fail. The treasurer should be focusing on the upcoming event, not this. Trust me, Nagen. I know I wasn't the greatest leader, but I know people."

    "He has a point. There's only so much we can do at once."

    #[IF Villain]

    h "I thought we were done with the whole 'rule with an iron fist' thing. All it did was make everyone hate us."

    n "There's more important things than being liked."

    h "Nagen, you're not listening to me. I don't think we should be butting our heads into other peoples' business. It would make us hypocrites. If this is the direction the council's going, then maybe..."

    n "Maybe what? This is my one chance to prove I'm a better leader than... other people."

    h "I just think you should be careful who you trust."

    "He has a point. It would be better if I took care of this myself."

    #[Return to Main Branch]

    n "Kietsu, I'll look into it. They probably didn't come to us because there aren't any club slots open."

    "Uitto comes rushing to our sides as he walks off."

    u "I don't think Jona's coming with. He's still trying to find his sketchbook."

    h "Still? Maybe someone really did steal it."

    n "There's not much we can do right now other than report it and hope it turns up."

    u "We should grab him some stuff from the cafe while we're there. Just in case."

    "Not long ago, he'd say every little thing on his mind like word vomit. But after the riots started, he wouldn't let anyone see what he was working on. I even caught him burning a few of his pieces in the past."

    #[BG: Hall]

    u "Why would I do that?"

    i "Do you really need a reason?"

    u "Um, yeah. You're asking me to put my reputation on the line so you can cheat. That's a shit deal with zero reward for me."

    i "Rise said the same thing. I think. I know she won't help."

    u "I didn't say I won't help. I said your idea sucked and would get me in trouble. Just, don't tell anyone, especially my friends. Jona can't keep a secret to save his life."

    n "Trade chain?"

    u "You know; person A wants something from person B who wants something from person C, etcetera etcetera. Luckily, most people want nice masks or outfits, but there's only a few people who know how to make that stuff. Which reminds me... I kinda promised Shoma we'd be his dress dummies."

    n "Most of the guys here are taller than me. How's that supposed to work?"

    u "Hiro's going to be helping out too. Basically, we're going to be stuck wearing the rejects. Shoma agreed to help so long as his designs don't end up in the trash."

    n "That's fair. What about Jona?"

    u "Got him on mask detail. It's helping him stay distracted from everything that's been going on."

    u "Nothing that concerns you, I assure you."

    n "I'll put on my best assured face on, just for you."

    "The wall is up. For whatever reason, she doesn't feel comfortable talking to me about it."

    u "Thanks. I highly value my diva-dumbass confidentiality policy. It's the only way to know what goes on on the 'other side'."

    n "Is there really an 'other side' now? All of us are scrambled in different classes and I'm pretty sure the teachers don't care which course we were in."

    "Or the other students for that matter. All things considered, I've talked to more kids from the 'normal' class now than I did before."

    u "Nagen, the only reason Rei still talks to us is that sense of classroom loyalty. The 'good kids' and 'bad kids' classes may be gone, but the pack mentality lingers. We all went to the same elementary school, but I still feel like an outsider. Maybe it's just me. Hiro seems to have been accepted by everyone again just fine and Jona's vibing as best he can."

    n "I know in my head that it doesn't matter if people here think we're cool but damn it, I'm sick of people feeling forced to talk to me."

    u "Oh my God, yes! Like, I don't need the red carpet treatment. Just that little glimmer in the eye that says they're happy to see you? I'll take passive acknowledgment at this point. Anything that doesn't make me feel guilty for breathing."

    "Every table is covered in stacks of hastily cut out patterns. Peels of scrap fabric obscure the floor under a patchwork mess of color. Samples of trim and lace have been pushpinned into the wall and the heat from his collection of candles makes it feel like I'm walking into a dungeon. One lone table has Jona's crafting supplies sprawled out across it with multiple masks drying in varying states of completion."

    "A shiver runs down my spine."

    n "No. I tried once. I wasn't successful."

    j "See?"

    sh "It doesn't hurt to ask. You never know when someone has a hidden talent."

    n "Jona, what are you doing?"

    j "Palette coordinating. Shoma's limited in what he can make, so I want to make sure the masks I make match what he's working on. Wouldn't want anyone looking silly."

    n "I'm sure people won't care as long as they look nice."

    j "I would care. I would notice. I'd feel bad."

    n "Isn't that easier?"

    sh "You'd be surprised how often my 'a suit' is the wrong suit because I don't like making boring, black three piece sets."

    n "I see. Well, I may not be able to sew, but I could do other things like cleaning or-"

    j "NO! No 'cleaning', we have a system."

    sh "Don't mess with the system, man."

    j "The minute you start throwing things out is the minute we gotta dig through garbage looking for lost pieces."

    sh "You can help cut out patterns. Jona's been trying but..."

    "He then whispers to me."

    sh "He took thirty minutes to cut one sleeve because it had to be 'perfect'. We got ten more outfits to do and I sew faster than he cuts."

    sh "I thought having all those stuck-up rich kids asking for my help would feel more cathartic than this."

    n "Is that the only reason you volunteered to help?"

    sh "Not really, I'll take any excuse to make stuff. It's just, after everything that happened, I thought I'd finally get some kind of closure. Some kind of grand sign that things were going to be different this time."

    j "Being treated better isn't the same as an apology. And they aren't going to apologize. You have to think you've done something wrong to want to apologize."

    n "Even if they did apologize, it wouldn't make me feel any better. We're all in one class now, that should be all that matters. Everyone's just so defensive now. Either they're trying really hard to seem happy or they're not trying to do anything at all. I'm not sure what's worse."

    j "Both. Being fake happy and doing nothing. It's the perfect recipe for suffering."

    sh "....."

    sh "Well, once one of our own is in charge of the school, it really will be a different story. Cause, like, they won't be the ones making the rules anymore."

    n "What do you mean?"

    sh "The other council kids are total outsiders. Even Nanase's basically cut off from the rich kid circle. Which means if you're president, they won't have a single kid in the room."

    "But none of them want my position... At least, that's what I've been told. Still, it will be nice to tell people what to do again, even if I've had a bit of a rocky start."

    sh "That's when it'll really feel like it changed, right?"

    n "Y-yeah."

    "I do my best to cut out all the pieces he'll need. By the end, there has to be at least one hundred pieces of carefully cut pieces amongst a pile of scraps."

    n "This is going to take forever to put together."

    j "Yeah, but it'll be worth it when it's all done."

    sh "...Yeah..."

    "I go to throw away my scraps and immediately-"

    sh "What are you doing?!"

    j "We have a system!"

    sh "Don't mess with the system, man."

    Nurse "Hun, you were fine. Your dad was the problem. He had a list of who was allowed to take care of you, he had hidden cameras in the room. The guy fired me for holding your hand without gloves on. No one blamed you for being grumpy when you had a six foot helicopter hovering around you twenty-four seven.

After we fix it up, it'll be fine for a while, but it's only a matter of time before it gives you problems again. Alternatively, over break, you could have it removed. I'm not saying you have to, but if you're going to keep it, you have to take care of it. Otherwise it can go."

    "It is weird. The only thing getting into fights here would do is hurt our chances at getting parol, but no one here knows that. Unless..."

    n "Jona, I think you may be onto something."

    j "Really?"

    n "Whatever you do, you can't let the other kids know messing with your sketches bothers you. "

    j "I think it's a little late for that."

    n "But if it seems like it's not working anymore, they'll get frustrated and try more extreme stuff to mess with you until they slip up. That's how we'll be able to catch them."

    j "Yeah, but I don't want them to do more extreme stuff. I want to be left the fuck alone."

    n "I mean, same, but I don't think that's realistic at this point."

    j "Well too bad. I'm going to keep doing what I want. I know you're trying to help, but I like my idea better."

    Dark "He tried drawing the kind of life he wanted."

    "Granted, half the time I couldn't make sense of it, but he definitely had an obsession with a 'living heaven'. He tried using his art to show what he wanted people to do to make the world a better place."

    Dark "But there was this monster he'd always draw."

    "It was a three-headed demon representing the first three majors that he depicted brutalizing innocent people and babies. He didn't have a name for it, it was just 'the thing we were supposed to fight'."

    Dark "People began worshiping the monster."

    "What was supposed to be a warning turned into a patron saint for the people that hated all Vision Majors because of Lethe. Suddenly, his drawings became grim prophecies of how bad the riots would become. The riots are over, but those people are still out there."

    "Piles of sketches cluttered his room of women with blonde hair and amber staffs. But without a reference, none of them really looked like her. The only thing he had to go off of were older drawings he did when she was still alive."

I don't have much energy at all. As I exit the office, I notice a drawing taped to the far wall. At first glance, one might lump it in with the educational posters, but the person who posted this deliberately avoided putting it on the bulletin board and it definitely wasn't there when I went in earlier. I take the picture off the wall."

Which is odd, since he had no problem talking with me when it came to Hiro and I's portraits, even when he thought we'd be mad. I look back at the drawings. While similar, the backgrounds are all different. Some are on what looks like TV sets or dressing rooms. Quite a few remind me of the stage back at Estella. Are these of different times? He takes them from me and folds them up so the drawings aren't showing, tucking them into his jacket pocket."

Hiro was worried when I didn't make it to dinner. I guess he ate alone last night. I'll admit, I'm a little concerned the others didn't get dinner, particularly Jona. It can be really easy for him to shut down when he doesn't know how to handle things."

    Dark "No one could convince him to change."

    "We didn't want him to get in trouble, but he didn't care. He started racking up detentions and every day, he'd come to school in a new set of oversized clothes. After four days, they called him to the office to meet with his mom. She said the next day he'd be in his uniform."

    Dark "He wasn't at school the next day."

    Dark "I offered to switch clothes with him."

    "It was the best thing we could think of at the time and it seemed to help a little. He finally told me that his grandma was the one who did laundry and made his breakfast before school every morning. His mom had tried, but she just didn't do things the same way and she assumed he knew how to do things he didn't."

    Dark "He'd brought a sealed wooden box to school."

    u "Go ahead. I'll let you know if there's anything important on screen."

    "Like a racehorse out of the gate, Jona is consumed by sketching. She's not going to be able to move from that spot for a while, I hope she knows that. I cue up the tape and take a seat on the floor next to Hiro. Again, the Karmic Gladiators' logo came on screen."

    r "'My terms' sounds an awful lot like your terms. Besides, you have no proof it was me. Any number of people could have left that note on Jona's desk."

    "That may be true, but there's a good reason to suspect her."

    #Branch A. Q1. Answer: Location of note

    n "I never told you where the note was found."

    r "Are you sure?"

    n "I have superhuman memory, so yes, I'm sure."

    r "You may have perfect memory, but I do not. I... think it is reasonable to assume it was at his desk. When people lack information, they often fill in the gaps with logical conclusions. Are you immune to that as well?"

    "She's pretty good at making it sound like she's in the right, but she's refusing to outright lie. I might be able to use that to my advantage. The threat letter lines up with something else that happened. If I use that, I can get her."

    #Branch A. Q2. Answer: Sketchbook Paper or Jona's Sketchbook

    n "No, you're right. I wonder where they got this paper from. Jona's sketchbook went missing for a while. It's be nice if we could get him a backup."

    r "They probably just used a page from the book when they stole it."

    n "I never said it was stolen, but it's interesting you assume the same person did both as well."

    r "...Great minds think alike."

    "Again, she won't outright deny it. Though all of this is circumstantial, none of it provides a motive. However, what she did with it gave away her intentions."

    #Branch A. Q3. Answer: Jona's Sketches

    n "Very peculiar they chose to share some of his drawings all over the school. They must have really wanted us to see how much Jona LOVED Uitto."

    r "A little too much, I would say."

    n "Yeah, too bad he didn't draw any of us."

    "She purses her lips."

    n "I would have loved to see what I'd look like."

    "Her eyebrow twitches."

    n "He rarely draws people unless he really likes them."

    r "Quite a charitable reading. Neither I nor Uitto found the drawings of her flattering, and we rarely agree. IF there were drawings of you, I do not think you would want anyone seeing them. In fact, I think you would pocket it so fast no one else would have a chance to see it. Your right pocket, probably. So before acting so coy, consider that other people may have a clearer understanding of what is going on than you."

    "How the hell did she know which pocket I put it in? I can't let her get into my head. She's clearly backed into a corner. She may be good at dressing things up, but she gave herself away the minute she made the note."

    #Branch B, Q1. Answer: Magazines

    n "You said yourself these could have come from your magazines. Lending them out would make for the perfect cover. Especially since it would have been after this note was made. No one else knew about the dance until later that day."

    r "I also said there could be issues from the library here. There are thousands of books and magazines here. You have no way to prove those clippings could not have come from there."

    n "But damaging the collection's against the rules!"

    r "...So is threatening a student."

    "Right. I can't prove she owned the magazines, but that doesn't mean she didn't do it. The method of making the note matches something else."

    #Branch B. Q2. Answer: Clippings

    n "You're also the only one I've seen cutting up magazines at all. Those little party books of yours are mostly magazine collages."

    r "Those 'party books' were made before the riots. Just because you saw me make one, does not implicate me as some sort of bully."

    "But she left something behind that proves she made it."

    #Branch B. Q3. Answer: Nail Polish

    n "No, what implicates you is the nail polish you left behind. The smudges on the page match the color you're wearing."

    r "As you can see, my manicure is intact. I have been more than willing to share my cosmetics with anyone."

    "She must have redone them to cover her tracks?"

    r "If we are talking about hard evidence, you would be better off checking who that hair belongs to. I am a natural blonde so it is not mine."

    n "That would be convenient for you, which is probably why you planted it there."

    r "Honestly Nagen, none of our classmates have gone around saying I pulled hairs out of their head, have they? We all lock our doors when we leave. How could I get someone else's hair to put there in the first place?"

    #Branch B. Q4. Answer: Location of the Note

    n "Ichita shares the same homeroom as Jona. I haven't seen any janitors around here, have you? It's entirely possible that you found one while dropping off the note. In fact, I bet you got the idea from your own hair flailing on the page and messed up your nails trying to get it out."

    r "So you proved it is not Ichita. That does not excuse the fact that someone else with the same nail color did what you said I did."

    "True, but when you look at the note closely, there's one last thing that points to her."

    #Main Branch. Answer: Dance

    n "The student council originally planned to throw a party. You and Ichita were the ones pushing for a dance. You're also the only one in that room that wears nail polish."

    r "You wear nail polish."

    n "Mine's black and I wouldn't do this to my own friend. I'm interrogating you!"

    r "You still do not have any solid proof. All of your evidence is purely circumstantial. If it comes down to a he-said, she-said; I have the upper hand. You are a convicted criminal and I am one of your victims."

    n "I want half."

    r "Half of what?"

    "Nooo, don't just say anyone. No one's raising their hand. God this is painful."

    j "There was Memento Mori, Lethe, and I still say Babylon counts."

    n "You just assume she doesn't study the language before she understands it, that doesn't mean-"

    n "Twenty-five years ago."

    v "And Vision was recognized as a Major when?"

    n "...Fifteen years ago."

    "The same would go for Jona. He sees auras around people. She makes another column on the blackboard."

    "We throw around ideas until the bell rings."
