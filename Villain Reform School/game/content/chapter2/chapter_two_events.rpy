    #These scenes will be different based on who Nagen's date is. These scenes will be separated by character name.

    #"Momoko"

    "We had agreed to meet up right outside the entrance; something about a surprise."

    mh "Shut up!"

    "I turn to see Momoko covered in black lace, and her mask... she's also a swan?"

    mh "We match! So gross, we're gonna give people cavities."

    "She gives me a huge hug."

    mh "You ready?"

    n "Kind of..."

    mh "It'll be fine as long as people have fun, right? So let's go have fun!"

    n "Yeah... Oh! I almost forgot."

    "She tilts her head to the left."

    n "You look beautiful."

    "She blushes and turns away."

    n "I mean it."

    mh "I know you mean it, you little weirdo. Just, y'know, brain. Words."

    "She shrugs and takes my hand."

    mh "Thanks."

    #"Kitsune"

    "Kitsune had been busy up until the last minute trying to campaign for the queen of the dance. She still made time to text me updates in between. Well, that and a list of expectations. Heaven forbid I wear the wrong shoes. We meet up at the front entrance. I'm not sure what she's supposed to be, but it's elaborate. She covers her mouth with her hands."

    k "Nagen..."

    "She's kind of bouncing up and down, making a circular motion with her finger."

    k "I want to see."

    "Oh, she's talking about me. I turn and when I circle back, she's beaming."

    k "It's perfect! Like straight out of a fairytale."

    "What's supposed to come next? Oh yeah, the corsage thing. I think it goes on the wrist, but which one? She never specified."

    k "Nagen, relax."

    "She holds out her left hand and I fumble trying to get the silly thing on. She tilts my chin up with her other hand, hesitating before patting my cheek."

    k "We're going to blow everyone away. Tonight's our night."

    "Easy for her to say, I still feel like I don't know what I'm doing. Well, too late to turn back now. I offer her an elbow and escort her in."

    #"Chisei"

    "Chisei is already at the entrance waiting for me when I show up. I hope I didn't keep her waiting too long."

    n "Sorry, I didn't-"

    "She turns and I forget to breathe for a moment. Her mask and arm look like they're made out of porcelain; she's like a doll."

    ch "Good silence or bad silence?"

    n "Ah, g-good."

    "She smiles."

    ch "You look quite dashing as well, for someone with a foul reputation."

    "Fowl, bird. I groan and she smiles even wider. Why does she revel in my misery?"

    ch "I am sure everyone will flock towards you when they see you."

    n "Stop, please!"

    ch "Music to my ears."

    n "You keep this up and I will throw this mask in the trash."

    ch "Oh, there is no need for that. You look really handsome."

    "She kisses the back of my hand."

    ch "Shall we?"

    "I guess we're going in?"

    #"Nanase"

    "Nanase's collecting tickets at the entrance; people are slowly trickling in. Which is fine, I guess, but it's delaying my night. She looks nice in her vintage gown."

    nk "I forgot, some people take event start times as a suggestion."

    "Glad I'm not the only one that's irritated about this."

    d "What's your hurry, wallflower?"

    "Kazz and Dyre. I step in and take their tickets."

    n "Well, some of us have dates that aren't a dressed up body pillow."

    "A really well dressed body pillow, damn."

    d "Yeah, well, everyone's going to want to dance with my date."

    "He's got me there."

    nk "Nagen, will you get me some food? I think this is going to take a while."

    "Hunh, she seems really unhappy."

    n "Yeah sure."

    "I come back and Nanase is by herself again."

    nk "Thank you."

    "She stares at the plate in bitter silence."

    nk "You should go in without me."

    n "What? But we-"

    nk "I know, I just need a moment and everyone's not here yet. I don't want you missing the dance because of me."

    "It has been thirty minutes since the dance started."

    n "...Are you sure?"

    nk "...Yeah..."

    "If she says so, I guess I'll go in alone. It shouldn't take too long for the stragglers to show up."

    #"Rise"

    "I get a string of texts."

    r "'I will not be able to meet with you on time. There is an issue I must attend to first. I am truly grateful you accepted my invitation. It pains me that I cannot fulfill that promise. Enjoy the party without me. I will try to attend as soon as I can.'"

    "Did I just get stood up?"

    #"Mu"

    "Mu comes to pick me up and walk me to the dance hall. He's not all that dressed up actually; just a nice blazer and a plain mask and..."

    n "Earplugs?"

    mu "Hunh? Oh, ye, kind of embarrassing, but there are some types of sounds that really bother me. I never know what to expect at events like this, so I wear em just in case. I can still hear you though."

    n "That's fair. I just wish I knew sooner, I would've vetted the playlist for you."

    mu "No, no; that's totally unnecessary. Wouldn't be fair to the other people either, but I appreciate it."

    n "Let me do things for you."

    "I can't shake this gross feeling that I'm a crummy date. He hasn't said anything negative and we haven't done much; but it's still there, like I haven't earned it for some reason. I offer my elbow for him to take and try to hide my embarrassment. He kinda laughs and links his arm through mine."

    mu "I'll try my best. It's just... going to take getting used to."

    "It should be illegal to be that attractive. How am I going to make it three hours without looking like an idiot?"

    #"Yoku"

    "Yoku is pacing outside of the dance hall. I know Shoma's talented, but there's no way he had time to make a suit and a cape with that much detail. He had to have brought it from home. When he sees me, he relaxes a little."

    y "I'm starting to think I'm overdressed."

    n "Nonsense, this is amazing."

    "It's kind of funny how a little bit of flattery can leave him so flustered."

    y "Are you sure this is okay?"

    "He adjusts my mask for me, probably just looking for something to do with his hands."

    y "I mean, I know these kinds of events hold different meanings than the ones I'm used to, but still, your friends will see us."

    n "They'll like you, I'm sure of it. I already told them you're my date, so it's not like they'll be surprised."

    "He's acting like he's meeting my parents. It's kind of cute."

    n "Come on. The longer we stay out here, the more worried you'll get."

    y "Y-you're right."

    #"Taiga"

    "Usually Taiga wears clothes that are easy to move around in, stuff he once used as a circus performer. Tonight he's in a high waisted skirt or pair of pants; I can't really tell. An ornate robe threatens to swallow him whole. He has a white blouse underneath and no mask. Despite all the fabric, he's still moving quickly and lifts me up by the waist."

    n "Woah!"

    "I have to steady myself with my hands on his shoulders."

    t "No kiss?"

    "I am going to die of embarrassment. People are walking by us and I can tell by that smile he's doing it on purpose. I muster enough courage to give him a peck on the forehead and he puts me down."

    t "Heh, if I didn't know any better, I'd think you had a gay little crush on me."

    n "Probably because I do."

    t "That's okay. I do too."

    "There is only so much my heart can handle. I have enough adrenaline running through my system to rival six cups of coffee."

    t "So, are we going to go in or are we just going to stand here?"

    "I take his hand and lead him inside."

    n "You're lucky you're cute."

    t "You hear that everyone? He thinks I'm cute!"

    "I'm pretty sure everyone is well aware we're on a date right now, but that's not going to stop him from bringing it up at every opportunity like a dork."

    #Hiro

    "Hiro and I are getting ready together. I suppose there isn't a better time than now to give it to him. I hand him a corsage made with blue silk. It doesn't exactly go with his outfit, but it's the best way I could think of to show we're going together."

    h "Hunh, what's this?"

    n "It's, um, you pin it to your jacket."

    h "...Why?"

    n "Well, it's kind of traditional to give one to your date, but if you don't want it..."

    "Hiro drops the box."

    h "This is a date? Like, a 'date' date? Like, a romantic kind of date?"

    n "Yeah. Did I not make that clear? I'm sorry. If you... if you don't-"

    "Man, I can't even say it."

    h "Nonono, I just- God I'm so stupid. I would have brought flowers and junk. Uitto even asked if I wanted help and I said 'no' like an idiot. I'm messing this all up."

    "He covers his face with his hands."

    h "How do I put the pin thing on?"

    "I've never seen him so flustered before. I can't help but laugh."

    n "Come here, I'll put it on."

    h "Okay."

    #BG: Rooftop Night

    "I climb up the stairs to the roof, and man does it look good! Rise did a great job disguising all the junk as decorations. Music is playing, there's food; it actually looks like a dance! Yoku and Kazz are arguing about the music choice. Dyre's body pillow date is crowd surfing. Everyone seems to be having a good time. All that's left to do is vote for the king and queen for the dance. I can feel Uitto looking over my shoulder."

    n "I thought you were taking pictures."

    u "I am."

    u "Who you gonna vote for?"

    n "Why? Is there someone you had in mind?"

    u "...no."

    "Liar."

    u "But it would be a good idea to vote for someone dramatic, who shares your love of long words. I gotta be careful with the hints, she might hear."

    n "If you wanted me to vote for someone specific, you should have said something earlier."

    u "Didn't want to give you time to be weird about it."

    n "Weird how?"

    k "You! Quit trying to steal my votes."

    u "No one's stealing anything. Sorry, Nagen, gotta keep moving."

    n "Wait, weird how?"

    "Too late, she's already running."

    k "I don't care what she told you. I'm the only one here that cares about winning the crown. It's only fair I get it. Do the right thing, Nagen."

    n "I-"

    "She runs off after Uitto. What should I do?"

    #While all characters can be voted for, Chisei, Kitsune, Mu, and Hiro are the only viable candidates. Voting for them guarantees they win. Voting for anyone else triggers a stat check. If reputation is good, Hiro wins. If Hero > Villain, Chisei wins, else Kitsune wins.

    n "We're standing around talking, that's- this is kinda it."

    "He grin at me."

    n "No, nononono, you are not making me dance in public, no."

    h "Fine, be boring."

    "He backs away a little and starts dancing. At least, that's the easiest way to describe it. It's not any good and Uitto starts laughing uncontrollably, but..."

    t "You call that dancing? I'll show you dancing!"

    "More people start joining in. Of course, most of the Vigor majors are the best. Rei is classically trained and Kitsune's pretty good at something Uitto identifies as voguing."

    mu "...Why?"

    kk "What do you mean why? People voted for you, come on up."

    #BG: Nagen's Room

    "Everyone dragged themselves to my room. It's too late for everyone to stay over again, but I doubt anyone could sleep without knowing what was on it. Hiro and I are a little anxious about Uitto and Jona being in the same room again, but..."

    u "You can draw me if, and only if, you ask me to model for you first. Otherwise, it's not really a picture of me, is it?"

    "I'm impressed by her ability to rationalize so quickly. Jona isn't ready to talk so soon after everything that happened, but I can see him spinning a pencil around in his hand with his sketchbook in his lap. She sighs."

    u "Go ahead. I'll let you know if there's anything important on screen."

    "Like a racehorse out of the gate, Jona is consumed by sketching. She's not going to be able to move from that spot for a while, I hope she knows that. I cue up the tape and take a seat on the floor next to Hiro. The Karmic Gladiators' logo comes on screen."

    a "Rise Kisaki. Despite not having a real proficiency, you were able to make the social elite grovel for your approval. It would be a shame to let such talents go to waste; that's why we'd like to give you a second chance. We will help maintain the lie your parents set in motion and forge the information you need to keep your false pedigree. In exchange, you will help us eliminate an equally powerful influence. This is your chance to rewrite history, don't pass it up. Sincerely, Apex of the Karmic Gladiators."

    "The video cuts to static."

    h "You need to be more careful."

    u "He spent half the week in his room, can't get more careful than that."

    h "Not him, you. If their strategy is to divide and conquer, there's a good chance one of you might get targeted next."

    "Jona has a tight hold on Uitto's wrist. She doesn't pull away."

    u "As if they'd stand a chance. My life's an open book and Nagen's the one who bailed you guys out, remember?"

    n "Still, it wouldn't hurt to be more proactive. We accidentally helped someone make the trap meant for us. Rather than be more careful, maybe we could lay a trap of our own? Get them to come out of hiding, but how?"

    u "Until we know who the next target is for sure, we can't easily counter their methods. The best we could do is a buddy system of some kind."

    h "That'll work for now."

    h "Now that I think about it, everyone here has a proficiency."

    u "So? Most of us came from Estella."

    h "But not everyone from Estella came here. There were other survivors that didn't come here."

    "Hiro would know best. His job was keeping track of the soldiers."

    n "It wasn't uncommon for kids to 'loose' their status after entering highschool. That's what happens when everyone else catches up to you while you get stuck."

    u "But in that case, where did everyone else go?"

    h "I don't know. Maybe... maybe they're still at the shelter."

    "There's no way that many kids lost their proficiencies. It's just a coincidence. Either way, Apex used that fear to target Rise. The whole tone of this tape is different from Mariko's. It almost sounds like blackmail. The tape sputters to life. This time, Apex is sitting on a lavish throne with a masquerade mask. How did she- Did Rise draw inspiration from the tape or are we being watched in the school?"

    j "It comes and goes depending how overwhelmed I get. I've never had it stuck in overdrive though."

    "She hesitates, looking a little skittish."

    r "Yes, well, everyone is entitled to their opinions. What matters is that I promised to 'get rid of' Jona. Promises are meant to be kept."

    n "But Mariko has a proficiency, she-"

    r "She has a neurological disorder and rich parents. Which do you think the school actually cared about? The difference between them and us is that we never believed these talents were ours in the first place. They are titles that can be taken away. I cannot afford to lose mine."

    r "Planners. An elegant party always has some kind of theme or aesthetic. These were ones I brought from home, but I am afraid they are outside of our means now."

    "She flips the drying pages to the front. Cut out pictures of candles in jars and repurposed palettes are carefully organized with little notes next to them."

    r "I fear not. This is something I am unable to help with, unfortunately."

    n "What were you doing before class?"

    r "Working on my collages."

    #"-Red Hair-"

    r "Red hair, and a short one at that... Ichita or maybe even Mu would fit that description. Come to think of it, Ichita is also one of the class representatives. He would have known about the dance before most."

    n "He shouldn't have to."

    r "But are you shown the same courtesy? If they really are your friends, you should be able to rely on them to do that much."

    "I show Rise the note, but she has no reaction to it, she just looks at me."

    r "What do you want, Nagen? It is not like you to be so indirect."

    n "I want you to admit that you did this."

    r "I see, and why would I do that?"

    n "Because, if you agree to work with me, I can keep you out of trouble. You'll be exposed either way, at least this way it'll be on your terms."

    r "'My terms' sounds an awful lot like your terms. Besides, you have no proof it was me. Any number of people could have left that note on Jona's desk."

    "That may be true, but there's a good reason to suspect her."

    #Branch A. Q1. Answer: Location of note

    n "I never told you where the note was found."

    r "Are you sure?"

    n "I have superhuman memory, so yes, I'm sure."

    r "You may have perfect memory, but I do not. I... think it is reasonable to assume it was at his desk. When people lack information, they often fill in the gaps with logical conclusions. Are you immune to that as well?"

    "She's pretty good at making it sound like she's in the right, but she's refusing to outright lie. I might be able to use that to my advantage. The threat letter lines up with something else that happened. If I use that, I can get her."

    #Branch A. Q2. Answer: Sketchbook Paper or Jona's Sketchbook

    n "No, you're right. I wonder where they got this paper from. Jona's sketchbook went missing for a while. It's be nice if we could get him a backup."

    r "They probably just used a page from the book when they stole it."

    n "I never said it was stolen, but it's interesting you assume the same person did both as well."

    r "...Great minds think alike."

    "Again, she won't outright deny it. Though all of this is circumstantial, none of it provides a motive. However, what she did with it gave away her intentions."

    #Branch A. Q3. Answer: Jona's Sketches

    n "Very peculiar they chose to share some of his drawings all over the school. They must have really wanted us to see how much Jona LOVED Uitto."

    r "A little too much, I would say."

    n "Yeah, too bad he didn't draw any of us."

    "She purses her lips."

    n "I would have loved to see what I'd look like."

    "Her eyebrow twitches."

    n "He rarely draws people unless he really likes them."

    r "Quite a charitable reading. Neither I nor Uitto found the drawings of her flattering, and we rarely agree. IF there were drawings of you, I do not think you would want anyone seeing them. In fact, I think you would pocket it so fast no one else would have a chance to see it. Your right pocket, probably. So before acting so coy, consider that other people may have a clearer understanding of what is going on than you."

    "How the hell did she know which pocket I put it in? I can't let her get into my head. She's clearly backed into a corner. She may be good at dressing things up, but she gave herself away the minute she made the note."

    #Branch B, Q1. Answer: Magazines

    n "You said yourself these could have come from your magazines. Lending them out would make for the perfect cover. Especially since it would have been after this note was made. No one else knew about the dance until later that day."

    r "I also said there could be issues from the library here. There are thousands of books and magazines here. You have no way to prove those clippings could not have come from there."

    n "But damaging the collection's against the rules!"

    r "...So is threatening a student."

    "Right. I can't prove she owned the magazines, but that doesn't mean she didn't do it. The method of making the note matches something else."

    #Branch B. Q2. Answer: Clippings

    n "You're also the only one I've seen cutting up magazines at all. Those little party books of yours are mostly magazine collages."

    r "Those 'party books' were made before the riots. Just because you saw me make one, does not implicate me as some sort of bully."

    "But she left something behind that proves she made it."

    #Branch B. Q3. Answer: Nail Polish

    n "No, what implicates you is the nail polish you left behind. The smudges on the page match the color you're wearing."

    r "As you can see, my manicure is intact. I have been more than willing to share my cosmetics with anyone."

    "She must have redone them to cover her tracks?"

    r "If we are talking about hard evidence, you would be better off checking who that hair belongs to. I am a natural blonde so it is not mine."

    n "That would be convenient for you, which is probably why you planted it there."

    r "Honestly Nagen, none of our classmates have gone around saying I pulled hairs out of their head, have they? We all lock our doors when we leave. How could I get someone else's hair to put there in the first place?"

    #Branch B. Q4. Answer: Location of the Note

    n "Ichita shares the same homeroom as Jona. I haven't seen any janitors around here, have you? It's entirely possible that you found one while dropping off the note. In fact, I bet you got the idea from your own hair flailing on the page and messed up your nails trying to get it out."

    r "So you proved it is not Ichita. That does not excuse the fact that someone else with the same nail color did what you said I did."

    "True, but when you look at the note closely, there's one last thing that points to her."

    #Main Branch. Answer: Dance

    n "The student council originally planned to throw a party. You and Ichita were the ones pushing for a dance. You're also the only one in that room that wears nail polish."

    r "You wear nail polish."

    n "Mine's black and I wouldn't do this to my own friend. I'm interrogating you!"

    r "You still do not have any solid proof. All of your evidence is purely circumstantial. If it comes down to a he-said, she-said; I have the upper hand. You are a convicted criminal and I am one of your victims."

    n "Yeah, well, that's a risk I'm willing to take."

    r "What do you want?"

    #"A. Surrender (+Hero, +Rep)"

    n "And what's that?"

    r "I need my father's company back."

    n "Your father? I thought Jusa Cosmetics belonged to your mom."

    r "...Thank you. I know it is difficult to trust people right now. "

    "She held out her hand then flinched. Her eyes are bloodshot. They weren't like that before."

    n "Rise?"

    r "I need a mirror."

    "She kept grabbing the air, and scrunched her eyes closed. A constant stream of tears made her makeup run."

    n "What the hell's going on?"

    r "The walls have ears Nagen, please. "

    "I walked her to the restroom."

    n "Maybe we should get you to a nurse?"

    r "I'm fine, they're just sticking."

    "Contacts shouldn't stick. I didn't think I should follow her into the bathroom, but she's crying and something wet definitely hit the counter."

    n "Rise?"

    r "I'll be okay… I have to be…"

    "I had to walk her back to her room."

    #"B) Money (+Villain, -Rise, +Rep)"

    r "Nagen, I'm sixteen, what makes you think I have any money?"

    n "Your parents were ridiculously wealthy. Even if you don't have a trust fund, you have to have assets of some kind. That dress alone is a couple hundred dollars."

    r "Maybe before the riots, but luxuries are not in high demand right now. I will be penniless until graduation, that's part of the reason I'm so desperate right now."

    n "I want half."

    r "Half of what?"

    n "I want half of everything you're worth, or I'll let that cultist group know who and where you are."

    "She went pale."

    n "They'll also be around after we graduate."

    r "You'd really stoop so low? Those monsters burned people at the stake!"

    n "Well I'd rather have the money. I just don't trust you to keep your word without proper motivation."

    "She nodded, though she looked like she was going to be sick."

    n "Obviously, this stays between us. You wouldn't want to risk the people here hating you."

    "She nodded again."

    n "Pleasure doing business with you."
