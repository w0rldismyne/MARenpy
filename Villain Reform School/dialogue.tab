MarikoOutro_fb0de6aa	m	I see... I hope, for your sake, you don't get hurt over this.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2603	m "[what]"
MarikoOutro_9df597d4	m	We've all been through enough without adding to the body count.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2604	m "[what]"
MarikoOutro_a6c7f5c8	m	I can see where you're coming from, though. You're a good friend.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2605	m "[what]"
MarikoOutro_5c7293a2	n	Uhh... thanks, I guess.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2607	n "[what]"
MarikoOutro_71722565		If I stick around any longer, I'll get roped into making posters for a club I'm not in. I should go.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2609	"[what]"
MarikoInt_183623a2		Between what everyone’s been seeing, and how she's been acting, I'm sure she's behind the PA Incident.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2621	"[what]"
MarikoInt_8049b556		However, it’s too soon to get her to admit it, especially with how defensive she’s been lately.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2622	"[what]"
MarikoInt_50b07f28		If I want her to talk, I should ask her about something innocuous; something that would connect her to the recording booth without sounding like an accusation.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2623	"[what]"
MarikoInt_962ab2af	n	I know you're busy with the cheer squad, but don't you talk to people outside of cheer?	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2625	n "[what]"
MarikoInt_7c05cae2	m	.....	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2627	m "[what]"
MarikoInt_28ffabf9	m	Yeah, I'm talking to you, aren't I?	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2628	m "[what]"
MarikoInt_15868f04	n	Well- yeah, but aren't there other people you're close to?	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2630	n "[what]"
MarikoInt_380b7be0	m	I've been talking to Shoma about uniform assignments a lot lately, if that's what you're getting at.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2632	m "[what]"
MarikoInt_5d2f6604		No good. I'll have to work backwards then and show proof someone thinks they're close to her.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2634	"[what]"
Mariko1_9b180254	n	You're friends with Kazz and his group too.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2642	n "[what]"
Mariko1_d10ea3fc	m	He's a nice guy and all, but 'friends' is a little strong of a term.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2644	m "[what]"
Mariko1_6be6c26b	m	We were in the same homeroom class at Estella, so talking to him came a little more naturally.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2645	m "[what]"
Mariko1_abc67031	m	'What have you been up to?' That kind of stuff. Why does it matter that I talk to other people?	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2646	m "[what]"
Mariko1_806a36ad		She's trying to downplay their connection, but it explains some things.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2648	"[what]"
Mariko1_662ac52d		If they knew each other before, it's make sense that he'd want to impress her.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2649	"[what]"
Mariko2_8a9f88ab	n	It doesn't really. It's just that Kazz can be pretty naive sometimes.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2668	n "[what]"
Mariko2_0bfba076	n	I heard his first day here, he told everyone who would listen about all the junk he smuggled in.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2669	n "[what]"
Mariko2_60069edd	n	That includes what was found in the PA booth. I'm sure you're one of the first people he went to.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2670	n "[what]"
Mariko2_2175d05e	m	So what if I was? He told a lot of people about that stuff. I mean, even you know about it.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2675	m "[what]"
Mariko2_db46a3a7	m	Besides, that has nothing to do with me. There isn't any proof the stuff that was in there belonged to Kazz in the first place.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2676	m "[what]"
Mariko2_7345de7e		I'm positive the recording device was Kazz's.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2678	"[what]"
Mariko3A_3d58ebff	n	Dyre's been telling people he handed Kazz's Echo directly to you so you could hide it in the booth.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2697	n "[what]"
Mariko3A_b2d69842	n	It seemed funny to him before stuff actually went missing.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2698	n "[what]"
Mariko3A_bdb8e5d6	n	There was only one Echo there, so it should be his.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2699	n "[what]"
Mariko3A_f181dd54	m	You don't know that.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2701	m "[what]"
Mariko3A_266202c8	n	Are you saying he lied? I wouldn't be surprised, but if he hears you've been telling people otherwise-	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2703	n "[what]"
Mariko3A_9fbd51b9	m	Don't! He told a few people about doing that, but we couldn't go through with it.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2705	m "[what]"
Mariko3A_364ff250	n	Then do you still have it?	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2707	n "[what]"
Mariko3A_955e8bf4	m	N-no. I hid it somewhere else. Like I said, none of us could get in.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2712	m "[what]"
Mariko3A_285b4be3		Now that's just a bold-faced lie.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2714	"[what]"
Mariko4A_2926bc84	n	You're one of the few people who could get in at all.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2733	n "[what]"
Mariko4A_e7798c9e	n	Even Setsuna couldn't get in. That made you the perfect pawn for Dyre's prank.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2734	n "[what]"
Mariko4A_c27277a7	n	Not only that, it gave you a pretty good alibi too. No one would question why you had his stuff if Dyre was talking up a prank you were helping with.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2735	n "[what]"
Mariko4A_44edbfaf	m	So? Nagen, are you seriously accusing me of manipulating my classmates?	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2740	m "[what]"
Mariko4A_1c8c78d9	n	No, I think you just saw an opportunity and took it. I'm sure I'm not the only one who suspects as much.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2742	n "[what]"
Mariko4A_2d029d66	n	They're just too nice to confront you about it.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2743	n "[what]"
Mariko4A_be4f7927	m	An opportunity to do what? Quit dancing around the subject and spit it out.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2745	m "[what]"
Mariko4A_f9f4daca	n	You're the one who called out a challenge to Hiro on the PA system.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2747	n "[what]"
Mariko4A_77088ba6	n	You borrowed the keys from Kietsu and returned them after the message played.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2748	n "[what]"
Mariko4A_9fdf1169	n	You're the only one who could have done it.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2749	n "[what]"
Mariko4A_6b6d6c95	m	All of this is just gossip, Nagen. Even if Kietsu kept track of when the club leaders had the key, none of that proves I was ever in the booth.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2751	m "[what]"
Mariko5A_e27b87fb	n	This is your ad, right here, and it was turned in after the other club leaders.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2771	n "[what]"
Mariko5A_9de2bceb	n	You were the last person in the booth before the announcement went off.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2772	n "[what]"
Mariko3B_a9e4de61	n	All you have to do is ask it who's logged into it.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2782	n "[what]"
Mariko3B_306d1ec0	n	It should tell you right away if it belongs to him.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2783	n "[what]"
Mariko3B_2330f977	n	If nothing else, you could ask it to play his music or any number of things he programmed that thing to say.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2784	n "[what]"
Mariko3B_9031fbaf	m	Alright, I get it. It doesn't matter anyway. The teachers have it, remember? There's no way to check it.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2789	m "[what]"
Mariko3B_a6a16825	n	Right, but I could check the Echo that hasn't been confiscated and see if he's logged into that one.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2791	n "[what]"
Mariko3B_31429aa7	m	You wouldn't.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2796	m "[what]"
Mariko3B_b13c8443	n	It'd be a quick walk to Shoma's workshop is all.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2798	n "[what]"
Mariko3B_e7c83c45	n	You had access to Kazz's whole setup and he gave you just enough information that you could use it.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2799	n "[what]"
Mariko3B_6eaea461	m	Use it for what? Nagen, do I look like I'm someone who needs a digital assistant?	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2804	m "[what]"
Mariko3B_e2def7c0	n	More like a digital accomplice.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2806	n "[what]"
Mariko3B_3fd5906e		Without it, there'd be no way for her to have used the PA mic without getting caught.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2808	"[what]"
Mariko4B_55d42535	n	You used it to play your message without you having to stay in the booth to do it.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2826	n "[what]"
Mariko4B_cf49ffbe	n	You even looked up the instructions on how to get the machine to play a custom sound bite.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2827	n "[what]"
Mariko4B_a35fdb5d	m	Nagen, I'm a star athlete, but even I can't trigger a voice command and make it out without anyone seeing me.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2829	m "[what]"
Mariko4B_dbc50c84	m	Besides, I was in class, like everyone was supposed to be.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2830	m "[what]"
Mariko4B_55f34990		Seems like she's counting on that to be her alibi, however...	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2832	"[what]"
Mariko4B_37790b88	n	It could be remotely activated with anything Kazz was logged into, like his phone for instance. It has been missing for quite a while.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2834	n "[what]"
Mariko4B_ea575482	m	I did not steal his phone! Kitsune's the one who was wandering around school with something that didn't belong to her.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2838	m "[what]"
Mariko4B_6fe7f9b3	m	Ask Ichita, he was with her this morning.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2839	m "[what]"
Mariko4B_ec43626b		Interesting she brought her up, since their stories contradict each other.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2841	"[what]"
Mariko5B_774fc6f8	n	She's been telling everyone she gave it to you.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2857	n "[what]"
Mariko5B_6db86817	m	So you're just going to believe her over me, just like that? How is that remotely just?	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2859	m "[what]"
Mariko5B_e813146a	n	Well, it helps that Rei saw it happen.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2861	n "[what]"
Mariko5B_a8e41736	m	...Rei?	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2866	m "[what]"
Mariko5B_85d38b18	n	Are you going to accuse your best friend of lying too?	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2868	n "[what]"
Mariko5B_da173524	n	She has no reason to say something that would make you look like a thief. Or maybe she does, I don't know.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2869	n "[what]"
Mariko5B_1ad8eb5c	m	No. Rei's not- she doesn't lie. But that doesn't mean I have it. You can search my stuff, but you won't find it.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2871	m "[what]"
Mariko5B_dc9abb21	m	It's probably with the teachers, who knows what they do with contraband?	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2872	m "[what]"
Mariko5B_224f1a14	m	I took it there after I talked with Kitsune, which was before the announcement went off. So, yeah, you can't prove a thing.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2873	m "[what]"
Mariko5B_d9fd65ce		She's just going to keep denying stuff until I spell it out for her. I know for a fact it didn't go 'straight to the teachers'.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2875	"[what]"
Mariko5B_00bd0596		Multiple people have said as much.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2876	"[what]"
Mariko6B_b546623c	n	Leading up to the event, people kept hearing a siren in the hallway.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2894	n "[what]"
Mariko6B_d8742525	n	It really freaked people out, especially the student council who was meeting that morning.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2895	n "[what]"
Mariko6B_4eeefb78	n	Of course, I'm sure it would have freaked them out less if they knew what Kazz's ringtone sounded like.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2896	n "[what]"
Mariko6B_0bfb2566		She's ringing her hands quite a bit. Doesn't seem like she has anything to say to that.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2898	"[what]"
Mariko6B_920bec47	n	Kazz has been having people call it for days.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2900	n "[what]"
Mariko6B_3cd8e25d	n	Funnily enough, no one could hear it anymore after the announcements, no matter how many times it was called.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2901	n "[what]"
Mariko6B_ae57760c	n	It might have been given to the teachers then, but not before it could be used.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2902	n "[what]"
Mariko6B_deac94e9	m	Knock it off with the smug act. I don't care how many coincidences or testimonies you found, none of that proves I did it.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2904	m "[what]"
Mariko6C_9261f24a	n	I can search anywhere you say? Even the locker you're borrowing for uniform storage?	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2923	n "[what]"
Mariko6C_f1bcf50a	m	How- that has nothing to do with this.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2925	m "[what]"
Mariko6C_5bfab836	n	But you do have a second locker, the one that was originally assigned to Mu?	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2927	n "[what]"
Mariko6C_d237405d	m	Yeah, you're welcome to wade through the pompoms, but you're repacking it if you do.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2929	m "[what]"
Mariko6C_e23e76c5	n	No need. I just wanted to make sure we agree that's your locker now.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2931	n "[what]"
Mariko6C_7d212b3d	m	So what if it is? It's like you said, I'm using it to hold club supplies.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2936	m "[what]"
Mariko6C_c4c6a41c	m	Even if you told the teachers, I wouldn't get in trouble over that.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2937	m "[what]"
Mariko7_047d868a	n	Multiple people heard the siren coming from your cheer locker.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2955	n "[what]"
Mariko7_751e67a0	n	It got so bad, Setsuna had to bust into it to get the noise to stop.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2956	n "[what]"
Mariko7_7f49f979	n	Only she couldn't just mute the phone because it was password locked.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2957	n "[what]"
Mariko7_340e8515	n	If it wasn't, she might not have given it to the teachers at all.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2958	n "[what]"
Mariko7_cbca98c1	n	Both of them thought the locker still belonged to Mu, which I'm sure you were counting on.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2959	n "[what]"
Mariko7_e0dfa9cf	n	Also it's weird it was locked considering Kazz doesn't lock his phone.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2960	n "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_bedbc863	m	So?	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2968	m "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_f4f49ce1	n	That's all you have to say for yourself?	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2970	n "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_777b4190	m	I didn't use all that junk to hide from you, I did it to give everyone a chance to prepare.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2972	m "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_658fec0f	m	And since I don't see Hiro behind you, I take it you're not here to support me.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2973	m "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_6b80b759	n	Support what exactly?	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2975	n "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_1ae02ee0	m	You've seen this place, it's not safe. It's a place to hide us until we're adults no one's responsible for.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2980	m "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_17d6423c	m	Who knows what's going on out there while we're stuck here? The fighting could come back on our doorstep any minute.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2981	m "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_e62d7a04	n	You're being paranoid.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2983	n "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_246ba7c0	m	And who's fault is that exactly? I know it would be easier to run away, but I can't just leave Rei here by herself like that.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2985	m "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_0a59eda8	m	Hiro's my ticket for getting both of us out of here.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2986	m "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_562fc962	n	Says who?	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2988	n "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_cdbb9ef3	m	Like I'd tell you anything. I know I'm taking a gamble, but I'm not going to blow it by saying something I shouldn't.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2993	m "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_02f653e5	n	You're not even going to try and beg for forgiveness?	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2995	n "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_0cf989bd	m	From you? What are you going to do, tell on me? Hit me? I don't feel pain and I already knew I wasn't going to graduate.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2997	m "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_79145a0b		For a moment, her bravado falters.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2999	"[what]"
MarikoSuccess_300d695f	m	Hiro took everything I cared about and you just sat by and watched it happen. What else could you possibly do to me?	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	3001	m "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_c82979dc	n	You really haven't been talking to other people, have you?	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	3009	n "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_43d80e55	n	Sure, there are a few people who are mad that my friends and I are here, but more of them are pissed about what you did.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	3010	n "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_3470a148	n	You saw how Rei blew up at us. She'll barely talk to me now, imagine what she'd do to you.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	3011	n "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_cedc0421	n	Did you even tell her what you were planning?	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	3012	n "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_6be65412	m	......	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	3014	m "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_ce825e61	n	I can't guarantee you won't get in trouble with the faculty, but if you get expelled over this, it'll be my word against speculation.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	3016	n "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_843cf3f9	n	If we aren't on good terms by the end of this conversation, Rei won't want anything to do with you. That I can guarantee.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	3017	n "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_400cfa43	m	You rat.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	3019	m "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_8cd1e026	n	Is that a no?	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	3021	n "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_fccc0b74	m	What do you want?	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	3023	m "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_b612c7c6	n	Simple. Turn yourself in and I'll help downplay this whole incident.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	3025	n "[what]"
MarikoSuccess_f9d38d2f		Of course, there's no telling how much mileage I can get out of this afterward.	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	3027	"[what]"
MarikoSuccess_7c05cae2	m	.....	game/content/chapter1/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	3031	m "[what]"

chapter2_day7_event2_6a0a9648		So why do I feel like I look silly? Maybe it's the mask Jona made for it, or the fact whoever this was made for was at least five inches taller than me.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	4150	"[what]"

chapter2_day7_event3_a7833e4d		The council wanted to have one last meeting before the dance. We all busted our butts trying to get everything together in time.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	4206	"[what]"

chapter2_day7_event3_fa1334ff	ki	Yep! This did exactly what I thought it would. When people have a common goal to work towards, they're more likely to get along.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	4234	ki "[what]"
chapter2_day7_event3_5319f93f	nk	So this was supposed to be some elaborate team building exercise?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	4236	nk "[what]"

chapter2_day7_event3_1c5e3384	nk	Technically, it's illegal to store recordings like that without consent. It's more likely that the cameras stream.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	4250	nk "[what]"
chapter2_day7_event3_32d8796e	n	Which means, if one of the teachers isn't looking at the feed, no one sees it.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	4252	n "[what]"
chapter2_day7_event3_d25674f0	s	How would they know? The student that is. Isn't the whole point of the cameras to give the illusion of supervision?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	4254	s "[what]"
chapter2_day7_event3_3b84ddca	n	That's... that's a really good point. How have they been able to avoid getting caught this whole time?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	4256	n "[what]"
chapter2_day7_event3_84beab64	ki	I don't know, but I figured Jona would want this back. Or at the very least to know they don't have it anymore.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	4258	ki "[what]"
chapter2_day7_event3_75e1b106	n	Thanks.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	4260	n "[what]"

chapter2_day7_event3_62ee1e78	n	Yeah, it seemed kind of weird not to. Not exactly my idea of a first date. It's probably just going to be a bunch of standing around while music plays.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	4276	n "[what]"
chapter2_day7_event3_01326b55	nk	...Right, probably...	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	4278	nk "[what]"

chapter2_day7_event3_641d7fc2	n	Yeah, you're still trying to avoid Dyre, right? It's easier to avoid talking to people in a group.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	4284	n "[what]"
chapter2_day7_event3_7adda4fe	n	No, just my friends. I'm going to be pretty distracted and I don't want to, like, just run off and leave someone if something comes up.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	4288	n "[what]"
chapter2_day7_event3_1f2dc9c4	n	And it's just so early to think about that kinda stuff. I don't get how everyone can settle in so easily.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	4289	n "[what]"

chapter2_day7_event3_5d858e62	nk	Everyone's put so much effort into it, so if I don't do everything by the book, am I not gonna have any fun?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	4294	nk "[what]"
chapter2_day7_event3_1c80158a	nk	Or do people just say those things are fun because they put so much time in it? It's like, before I knew it, this thing turned into a couple's thing.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	4295	nk "[what]"

chapter2_day7_event3_cccf6ac8	nk	Thanks for the ticket to the dance, Nagen. I can't come in until the last ticket is returned, but it's nice to know there are people to hang out with inside.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	4311	nk "[what]"
chapter2_day7_event3_a0e30ece	nk	Not that there's no one to talk to. Just, it's different knowing someone's waiting for you.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	4313	nk "[what]"

chapter2_day7_event4_0efda354		I knock on Jona's door. He answers, but holds the door close to him, as if ready to close it at a moment's notice. He's still in his pajamas, though he is wearing his goggles.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	4350	"[what]"

chapter2_day7_event4_a302a636		He closes the door without another word. This is bad. He hasn't had to miss class like this in a while. I'll let the others know he's doing okay.

chapter2_day8_event2_ec5fca0d		She's pretty good at making it sound like she's in the right, but she's refusing to outright lie. I might be able to use that to my advantage.

chapter2_day8_event2_c94c72f6	n	No, you're right. I wonder where they got this paper from. Jona's sketchbook went missing for a while. It's be nice if we could get him a backup.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	5482	n "[what]"

chapter2_day8_event2_5b5ab6a8	n	Very peculiar they chose to share some of his drawings all over the school. They must have really wanted us to see how much Jona LOVED Uitto.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	5494	n "[what]"

chapter2_day8_event2_481bf740	n	He rarely draws people unless he really likes them.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	5506	n "[what]"
chapter2_day8_event2_e32bd54e	r	Quite a charitable reading. Neither I nor Uitto found the drawings of her flattering, and we rarely agree. IF there were drawings of you, I do not think you would want anyone seeing them. In fact, I think you would pocket it so fast no one else would have a chance to see it. Your right pocket, probably.

chapter2_day8_event2_d5c70796		How the hell did she know which pocket I put it in? I can't let her get into my head. She's clearly backed into a corner.

chapter2_day8_event2_a32739c4	n	You said yourself these could have come from your magazines. Lending them out would make for the perfect cover.

chapter2_day8_event2_e65526b3	r	I also said there could be issues from the library here. There are thousands of books and magazines here. You have no way to prove those clippings could not have come from there.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	5516	r "[what]"

chapter2_day8_event2_478a0125		Right. I can't prove she owned the magazines, but that doesn't mean she didn't do it. The method of making the note matches something else.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	5522	"[what]"
chapter2_day8_event2_86818d0a	n	You're also the only one I've seen cutting up magazines at all. Those little party books of yours are mostly magazine collages.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	5526	n "[what]"
chapter2_day8_event2_d36f0d5c	r	Those 'party books' were made before the riots. Just because you saw me make one, does not implicate me as some sort of bully.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	5528	r "[what]"
chapter2_day8_event2_f7b1ffdc		But she left something behind that proves she made it.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	5530	"[what]"
chapter2_day8_event2_874cc14e	n	No, what implicates you is the nail polish you left behind. The smudges on the page match the color you're wearing.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	5534	n "[what]"
chapter2_day8_event2_1244d6b5	r	As you can see, my manicure is intact. I have been more than willing to share my cosmetics with anyone.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	5536	r "[what]"

chapter2_day8_event2_36d4a8ba	n	That would be convenient for you, which is probably why you planted it there.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	5542	n "[what]"
chapter2_day8_event2_6d68dcb1	r	Honestly Nagen, none of our classmates have gone around saying I pulled hairs out of their head, have they? We all lock our doors when we leave.

chapter2_day8_event2_72567a84	n	Ichita shares the same homeroom as Jona. I haven't seen any janitors around here, have you? It's entirely possible that you found one while dropping off the note. In fact, I bet you got the idea from your own hair flailing on the page and messed up your nails trying to get it out.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	5548	n "[what]"
chapter2_day8_event2_806cd797	r	So you proved it is not Ichita. That does not excuse the fact that someone else with the same nail color did what you said I did.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	5550	r "[what]"
chapter2_day8_event2_6193be16		True, but when you look at the note closely, there's one last thing that points to her.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	5552	"[what]"
chapter2_day8_event2_632bc3a2	n	The student council originally planned to throw a party. You and Ichita were the ones pushing for a dance. You're also the only one in that room that wears nail polish.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_events.rpy	5556	n "[what]"

KazzInterrogation2_3d8051c8	kk	Well, you're his friend. I'm sure Uitto hasn't heard any of the rumors floating around the Charm department either.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	766	kk "[what]"
KazzInterrogation2_63556c5d	n	What rumors?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	767	n "[what]"
KazzInterrogation2_3bd50f52	kk	That he's faking his proficiency.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	768	kk "[what]"
KazzInterrogation2_8e6081e5	kk	Some people have been wondering if he's actually proficient in something like lying or manipulation and is covering it up with spooky stuff to seem cool.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	769	kk "[what]"
KazzInterrogation2_1ed68d95	n	Where'd you hear that from?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	770	n "[what]"
KazzInterrogation2_19c93a31	kk	Dyre.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	771	kk "[what]"
KazzInterrogation2_0b1818cc	kk	I've been trying to keep things as chill as possible on my end. The first week of school sucked. Real bummer it's happening again.A	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	774	kk "[what]"
KazzInterrogation2_d483435a	kk	nd Mariko's off who knows where, so it has to be somebody else, right?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	775	kk "[what]"
KazzInterrogation2_84e7b7a3	n	That's what it seems like.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	776	n "[what]"
KazzInterrogation2_5cc90b22	kk	Major buzzkill. I can't say I've ever gone out of my way to interact with Jona; he always avoided me. I have zero clue what would make someone do this.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	777	kk "[what]"
KazzInterrogation2_5710fc87		That might be my fault. I wasn't exactly subtle about why I was transferred to the at risk class, or the people who failed to follow me there.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	778	"[what]"
KazzInterrogation2_24df4959	kk	Is there anything else I can help with?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	782	kk "[what]" (20)
KazzInterrogation2_4a9f7cff	n	Nothing comes to mind.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	783	n "[what]"
KazzInterrogation2_935e39b7		Wait, why is he so eager to help? 	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	784	"[what]"
KazzInterrogation2_9700b56f	n	What are you procrastinating on?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	785	n "[what]"
KazzInterrogation2_89df943e	kk	Ugh, busted. Kitsune wants me to redo the entire album we made since my stuff got confiscated. The first time we did it, she was just hyped to finally record. Now she's got standards, and I'm afraid neither of us is skilled enough to meet them. I've retooled the same bridge three times, and she's still not happy with it.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	786	kk "[what]" (21)
KazzInterrogation2_083c1a91	n	Try telling her you're going for authenticity.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	787	n "[what]"
KazzInterrogation2_87140202	kk	Dude, that's genius.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	788	kk "[what]" (22)
KazzInterrogation2_48838b36	n	Also, no one else is making new stuff at the school right now. It could be a six out of ten, and people would still like it.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	789	n "[what]"
KazzInterrogation2_cfac3acf	kk	I'm not sure about that. This beast isn't for everyone.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	790	kk "[what]" (23)
KazzInterrogation2_fe7e91bc		He looks back at all the editing he has to do.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	791	"[what]"
KazzInterrogation2_cc0c540b	kk	Alright, I gotta kick you out or I'll keep dragging my feet on this last round of edits.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	792	kk "[what]" (24)
KazzInterrogation2_44847d0b	n	You got this.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	793	n "[what]"
DyreInv2_a7ea8890		Dyre is sitting at a table, surrounded by piles of books. The covers have pictures of brains on them or bland white textbook covers.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	798	"[what]"
DyreInv2_4aa8b277		Lots of stuff on brain injuries and personality disorders. He seems kind of frustrated, but then he sees me and puts on that smarmy mask of his.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	799	"[what]"
DyreInv2_220095e7	d	To what do I owe the pleasure?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	800	d "[what]"
DyreInv2_9b1d9af6	n	I think you know what. Someone stole Jona's sketchbook and of everyone here, you're the only one that's tried to pull pranks on people.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	801	n "[what]"
DyreInv2_22fe1013	d	Nagen, I'm no monster. I only jest with people who I know can hang. You haven't been in on the joke in years.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	802	d "[what]"
DyreInv2_7de2f572	n	I certainly don't find this funny. Last time you had an idea of who was harassing us and you chose to say nothing. I'm guessing you have some ideas again.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	803	n "[what]"
DyreInv2_42b29726	d	Alright, I'll bite. What do you want to know?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	804	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_f45bb0f1	d	Sure, I guess. What do you need?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	809	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_5752da44	n	Trash. There's going to be so much trash when we're done. If you could take the bags to the dumpster, that would be great.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	810	n "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_835576a6	d	Hardly a glamorous job.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	811	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_65185433	n	That's why no one wants to do it.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	812	n "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_af4e2f88	d	Alright. At least it's easy.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	813	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_883e69db	d	I've seen a lot of people looking at stuff like that.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	818	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_2ee8cb3d	d	Chisei especially, she likes to have references when writing set descriptions.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	819	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_b5b72905	d	I don't see her cutting one up anytime soon. Whoever did this probably owned them.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	820	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_2350699f	n	You think?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	821	n "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_792e22a6	d	If it was stolen, we would have heard about it, like with Jona and Kazz's stuff.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	822	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_63605651	d	If it was borrowed, the borrower would get caught as soon as the magazines were given back.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	823	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_953a865d	d	If you can find out who was lending them out, you'll be golden.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	824	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_7958af04	d	The note is misspelled. Hard to say they caught it when all the nail goop is up by the hair instead.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	827	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_738aa7b0	d	Doesn't look like the letters were moved around at all after they were placed.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	828	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_f9b63d79	d	I wouldn't be surprised if the person laying them down thought of them more as pictures than letters.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	829	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_e79563d2	n	So someone artistic?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	830	n "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_bc75c801	d	Depends on what you consider artistic.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	831	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_eddbb3c7	d	I know artists usually have bad handwriting, but there are other things they could have used to make this if art was their thing.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	832	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_087d87a5	d	It isn't mine. I know it looks like I spend hours in the mirror, but that's to try and straighten my hair, not the other way around.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	835	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_3a6ab739	d	Whoever's hair that is, it's naturally straight.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	836	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_75dba7a5	d	Rather than focusing on that, it's really weird how vague the note is. Mariko had a set deadline, but this is open ended and can be interpreted several ways.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	837	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_26565e59	n	Or they didn't know when exactly the dance was happening.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	838	n "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_5d82b26d	d	Also a possibility. I'm guessing they know how you think.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	839	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_b77af28c	d	People in the Charm department have had an issue with him and his family for years.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	843	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_f9ce684b	d	I'm sure you remember this, but his mom wasn't the nicest person when it came to him. She made it everyone's problem when the school tried to classify him as a Charm Major at first.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	844	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_7d6eb9aa	n	That's news to me.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	845	n "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_b40d48c7	d	Well, Charm Proficiencies can get grandfathered down. Kinda like a peer reviewed ability, but his mom refused to believe he had her ability.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	846	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_74994864	d	Kept accusing the staff of trying to curse him. They never could prove one way or another which class he should've been in.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	847	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_6ecad76c	d	Though I'm sure if you ask him, he'll double down on being a vision major.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	848	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_5136459d	n	That's 'cause he is.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	849	n "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_3b6cd2ac		He's got the emotional intelligence of a shoe. Most of the time, he's guessing what to do based on auras, but it's not like he has a mood ring guide. 	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	850	"[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_43982c47	d	Or he could be lying to himself. You'd be surprised what people can convince themselves of when the alternative is violent rejection.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	851	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_1939486d		He shrugs.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	852	"[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_358b9dfa	d	It doesn't matter if you think it's true, what matters is that other Charm Majors think it's true.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	853	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_ae7e5e0c		That was surprisingly helpful.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	857	"[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_75e1b106	n	Thanks.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	858	n "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_7d1207a7	d	What for?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	859	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_d7dd1b5e	n	For actually answering my questions.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	860	n "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_c858d1b4	d	I have no horse in this race. Forgive me for being a little defensive of my friend when the last time you took issue with someone, they woke up in a war zone.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	861	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_a2cd468a	d	It seems you learned your lesson.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	864	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_ae018a04	d	You haven't exactly been acting like someone who won't do it again.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	866	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_c7fbcb52	n	Either way, I appreciate it.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	867	n "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_24d81904	d	Yeah, whatever.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	868	d "[what]"
DyreInterrogation2_969dc51e		I leave him to his pile of books.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	869	"[what]"
KitsuneInv2_e284f115		Kitsune is standing on stage holding a tiny thing up to the stage lights. She tilts and rotates it around with a grim expression.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	874	"[what]"
KitsuneInv2_9cfbd5cd	k	Does this look like a rhinestone to you?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	875	k "[what]"
KitsuneInv2_b9d5ce6e	n	It looks like a gem.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	876	n "[what]"
KitsuneInv2_981edaa0	k	We don't have any, so I'm trying to make due with glue and candy wrappers. The glass ended up being too heavy. It's better than nothing at least.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	877	k "[what]"
KitsuneInv2_c9e0922a		There are a few other rejected attempts in her pocket. A couple of masks are sitting in the wings.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	878	"[what]"
KitsuneInv2_600af714		It seems anything she's thinking about wearing at the dance, she's brought to see how it would look on stage.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	879	"[what]"
KitsuneInv2_e0551005	n	You're taking this dance really seriously.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	880	n "[what]"
KitsuneInv2_ad067e9b	k	Of course! I'd like to keep doing fun things like this, but it only works if everyone's on board. You all have been working so hard, it only makes sense we should too.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	881	k "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_5aba0d09	k	Get out of here.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	885	k "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_7be82712	n	I'm sorry?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	886	n "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_1f9da7db	k	No! I mean, like, you're serious. Like, for real, for real? You want to go to the dance with me?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	887	k "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_76a007e1	n	Is that a problem?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	888	n "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_ae04b534	k	Are you kidding? Broody bad boys were like, in before the world went to shit.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	889	k "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_5fddc340	k	Being the only femme there with a date would totally show everyone who's actual prom queen material.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	890	k "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_b04335db		I feel like we're getting off topic.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	891	"[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_c347b60f	n	Is that a yes?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	892	n "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_e46e0b1f	k	Um, yeah. Of course it's a yes. My dress is based on a white peacock, dress accordingly.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	893	k "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_d768257b	k	I'll be spending a lot of time getting ready beforehand. Is there anything I could do after?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	898	k "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_f612386c		I'm surprised she didn't ask to sing.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	899	"[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_d874f239	n	We'll have a bunch of dishes that'll need to be brought back to the cafe. Think you can manage it?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	900	n "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_88ae75e6	k	Of course.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	901	k "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_e572ee89	k	Who cares about that?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	906	k "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_60a9a0a2	n	Well, Jona does-	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	907	n "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_d1105ea0	k	Hasn't Ichita been acting super weird lately? He's all secretive and scheme-y and he won't tell me anything, called me a blabber mouth.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	908	k "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_190e87d0	k	Me? A blabber mouth? Can you imagine?!	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	909	k "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_ee6ec2ba		Quite easily.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	910	"[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_13605824	k	I think he's up to something. I caught him whispering stuff to Uitto and they stopped talking as soon as they saw me.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	911	k "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_6935d757		Well, if Uitto's involved, they're definitely not going to tell you anything.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	912	"[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_960b6d5c	k	This is why all my colors are plastic.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	915	k "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_29eee094		She drills her fake nails against each other.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	916	"[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_bd44b75a	k	That's a pretty popular color right now. Rise, Rei and Chisei all wanted to wear it.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	917	k "[what]"

KitsuneInterrogation2_b07a7006	n	What?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	919	n "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_a8e933fd	k	All the girls have been whispering behind her back. It's absolutely awful to watch. Be extra nice when you see her next.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	920	k "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_2897b407	k	She doesn't want to go to any of the teachers about it. After the incident with Mariko, she's worried about 'overstating harm'.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	921	k "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_28d0b797	k	But I get it, there's not much the teachers can do to make people include her.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	922	k "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_07e36a1a	k	That's interesting.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	925	k "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_4700275c		She reaches into her backpack and pulls out a fashion magazine with a green cover.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	926	"[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_94e5d58d	k	Look familiar?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	927	k "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_deea0d25	n	Where did you get that?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	928	n "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_04e9fbe0	k	All of us with any taste pooled our collection together so everyone could look over references for the dance.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	929	k "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_ca070c02	k	I didn't include this one, because there were already duplicates. Whoever cut that up knew it wasn't the only copy, I guarantee it.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	930	k "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_10bb0fe3	n	Who else was pooling magazines together?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	931	n "[what]"

KitsuneInterrogation2_022c4e87	n	That's odd.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	933	n "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_739fe640	k	Kind of calculated if you ask me. As far as I could tell, it was a fun time seeing what everyone managed to fit in their suitcase.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	934	k "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_fe7f46f5	k	It kind of retroactively spoils it if he recognized the pieces like I did.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	935	k "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_7c846a50	k	Ew, why would I go anywhere near that lice factory?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	938	k "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_bb3bd271		I didn't realize that was common knowledge. When we were kids, his mom didn't take any of his concerns seriously.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	939	"[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_6ad8ca1e		She put him scratching in the same category as crying over shirt tags. That was one of the grosser things Hiro and I had to teach him about.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	940	"[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_97abd993	n	That was when we were ten.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	941	n "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_8d0fa865		She went silent.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	942	"[what]"

KitsuneInterrogation2_abe5e08c	k	I can't wait until we can buy stuff again. My fosters keep sending me allowance and I have nothing to spend it on.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	948	k "[what]" (23)
KitsuneInterrogation2_4036f15b	n	You get an allowance?!	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	949	n "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_6a6d84c0	k	Yeah... is that not normal?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	950	k "[what]" (24)
KitsuneInterrogation2_076651ba	n	For foster parents, no.	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	951	n "[what]"
KitsuneInterrogation2_0bcc7a17	k	Well, it's all going to Shoma as soon as we can buy fabric. I should probably keep that to myself, hunh?	game/content/chapter2/chapter_two_investigation.rpy	952	k "[what]" (25)

Uitto4_85d93f14	u	I’m garbage at choreography, always have been.	game/content/charm/uitto_pathway.rpy	709	u "[what]"
Uitto4_9250562b	u	Besides, I figured a bunch of meathead jocks would be more welcoming towards my competitive spirit.	game/content/charm/uitto_pathway.rpy	710	u "[what]"
Uitto4_c7c32d10	n	Well, I mean yeah, but you practically lived on the stage. I thought dancing was a part of your job.	game/content/charm/uitto_pathway.rpy	712	n "[what]"
Uitto4_ba08c7d5	u	Ideally everyone wants a singing, dancing mascot to advertise their product. Rosette wasn’t that lucky.	game/content/charm/uitto_pathway.rpy	714	u "[what]"
Uitto4_61b90e3a	u	Rinko could dance, Renge could sing, and I could make people think I did both. If you pay attention to the videos, you’ll notice I mostly walk and pose.	game/content/charm/uitto_pathway.rpy	715	u "[what]"
Uitto4_f481df17	n	And the singing?	game/content/charm/uitto_pathway.rpy	717	n "[what]"
Uitto4_8bbd3c87	u	Lip syncing to an auto tuned recording. I mean, it was still my voice, but it was heavily edited.	game/content/charm/uitto_pathway.rpy	722	u "[what]"
Uitto4_e6f3e63e	n	I’m so disillusioned.	game/content/charm/uitto_pathway.rpy	724	n "[what]"

Uitto4_d22e575d	n	It still feels kinda cheap.	game/content/charm/uitto_pathway.rpy	731	n "[what]"
Uitto4_a11099f8	u	It’s not cheap, it’s a lifestyle, a methodology you eat, sleep, and breathe.	game/content/charm/uitto_pathway.rpy	736	u "[what]"
Uitto4_853363c0	u	Saying my performance was lacking because I was showcasing different skills is like saying you’re stupid because you can’t write a short story.	game/content/charm/uitto_pathway.rpy	737	u "[what]"

Uitto4_4097e723	u	So, I treated each performance like a challenge. No point in embarrassing yourself unless there’s something to win.	game/content/charm/uitto_pathway.rpy	752	u "[what]"
Uitto4_65617f8e	u	That’s what most people say. I think It’s kind of fun. You find what gets the best reaction and rack up brownie points until you get the best outcome.	game/content/charm/uitto_pathway.rpy	764	u "[what]"

Uitto4_57304630	u	It’s not the same with performing. There’s always an audience, even if it’s just you.	game/content/charm/uitto_pathway.rpy	777	u "[what]"
Uitto4_544dc36a		I can kind of understand that. Growing up, my one goal was to make my father happy. It was a fruitless venture, but that didn’t stop me from trying.	game/content/charm/uitto_pathway.rpy	779	"[what]"
Uitto4_06663d04		It got to the point where even if he wasn’t watching, I was still acting like he was.	game/content/charm/uitto_pathway.rpy	780	"[what]"

Uitto4_71d0f59a	u	Can’t sing, then become a great actress. Can’t fight, then be intimidating. Got a sucky family, then find a new one.	game/content/charm/uitto_pathway.rpy	807	u "[what]"

Uitto4_65a7ac5d	u	Your Proficiency is dull, your look is generally unappealing, and the whole event is designed to pick the contestants apart. It’d give you an anxiety attack.	game/content/charm/uitto_pathway.rpy	851	u "[what]"

Uitto4_a313cf39	u	...I don’t know. I never thought of it as my money, so I didn’t pay attention. It probably went back into the pageants.	game/content/charm/uitto_pathway.rpy	872	u "[what]"

Yoku2_4870cd9f	y	Were things the way they were sup-p-posed to be, I wouldn’t be staying in the dorms at all. My grandparents’ home was once in the a-area.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	376	y "[what]"

Yoku3_fbf780e2		Last time I talked to him, Yoku mentioned that his grandparents weren’t well off, but I’m certain he was a part of those uppercrust Proficiency mills. I wonder how he ended up there.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	403	"[what]"

Yoku3_22556def	y	I sup-p-posed I could entertain your curiosity for a minute.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	420	y "[what]"
Yoku3_a2768a58	y	To sum-m-marize, it was a bimonthly showcase where up-p-per class folks would go to pat each other on the backs.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	421	y "[what]"

Yoku3_8ff45896	y	If they would listen to you at all, the e-easiest way to reach them was through their children. I started going when I was fi-ive for that very reason.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	431	y "[what]"

Yoku3_6ebc4995		I started laughing, I couldn’t help it, picturing some snob disappointed that all their kid could do was hear well.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	448	"[what]"
Yoku3_8a34d3af	y	That’s not… status was based on bl-l-loodline more than skill.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	453	y "[what]"
Yoku3_f7dca0d7	y	I was at a disadvantage! That isn’t the reason at all. You’re twisting my words.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	454	y "[what]"
Yoku3_7f941094	n	Right, whatever you say.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	456	n "[what]"

Yoku3_26726d67		I think my head’s spinning. This is a lot to take in at once.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	469	"[what]"
Yoku3_e7db1140	n	I can’t believe people would do stuff like this to their kids.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	471	n "[what]"
Yoku3_099bd78f	y	A family’s l-legacy can outweigh the individual in many homes. Quite a few of my old ‘friends’ were the children of tycoons or p-politicians.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	476	y "[what]"
Yoku3_993cec22	n	Do you really think that?	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	478	n "[what]"

Yoku3_0a5cd07e	n	I wouldn’t know the difference. My parents were not big on ‘family values’. They didn’t even do enough to rank at mediocre.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	488	n "[what]"
Yoku3_d0bbc5a2	n	This whole dynasty thing is so alien to me, it sounds like a giant pain.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	489	n "[what]"
Yoku3_b58d9416	y	I don’t imagine you wo-ould have enjoyed it, n-n-o.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	494	y "[what]"
Yoku3_33deafa8	y	Excuse me?	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	502	y "[what]"

Yoku3_55ce990b	n	Demerit?	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	511	n "[what]"
Yoku3_a64fe907	y	One’s worth as a potential partner was carefully calculated; me-easured by achievements or demerits.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	513	y "[what]"
Yoku3_2790516f	n	You’re getting a little too technical on me.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	515	n "[what]"
Yoku3_a342c2da	y	Sorry. Let’s just say my per-erceived worth wasn’t ‘good’. I had a lot to prove, so the s-sooner I started, the better.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	517	y "[what]"
Yoku3_6a22a6fd	n	That’s so messed up. A kid shouldn’t have to prove their worth.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	519	n "[what]"
Yoku3_7e2b011b	n	Learning how to take care of yourself is enough without piling other crap on.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	520	n "[what]"
Yoku3_cc0a9a6b	y	Quite. Though, I’ll admit it’s nice to hear you assumed differently.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	525	y "[what]"
Yoku3_9032eadc	n	I’ve heard what you can do. If you just figure out how to market your work right, you’ll be leagues ahead of those trust fund babies.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	527	n "[what]"
Yoku3_80db93d7	n	The only one who remembers what those people thought of you, is you.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	528	n "[what]"
Yoku3_fc295f74	y	It’s true. I had hoped school here would be a fre-esh start for me.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	530	y "[what]"
Yoku3_8e8f51c2	y	My parents dreamed that the Y-Y-Yoku name would go down in music history under a legendary composer.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	538	y "[what]"
Yoku3_8b59ddc4	y	They shared with me their love of music and their dreams. On.nly, they didn’t intend for me to be that c-composer.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	539	y "[what]"
Yoku3_71e7b72e	y	I was viewed as a stepping stone toward that goal.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	540	y "[what]"
Yoku3_c9b760dc	n	Then why are you bothering with all the instruments and commissions? Isn’t that the golden ticket to do whatever you want?	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	542	n "[what]"
Yoku3_d1331105	y	I wa-ant to do this. Granted, the terms are a little extreme and I’m expected to fail, but that alone doesn’t m-mean I shouldn’t try.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	547	y "[what]"
Yoku3_2f88256d	n	But I mean, what would you get out of it? It just seems like a giant waste of time.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	549	n "[what]"
Yoku3_a089908e	y	I get to do what I love. I get to spend ev-veryday bringing something into existence that’s never b-been done before.	game/content/charm/yoku_pathway.rpy	554	y "[what]"
