chapter1_day3_event2_e3f2e3aa		If I didn't know any better, I'd think he was concerned.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2183	[what]
chapter1_day3_event2_3ebc81bd		I reluctantly agree to have him take a look, peeling open the front breast pocket of my under shirt while he gloves up.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2200	[what]

chapter1_day3_event2_c948b5c0		He hisses, probably because the whole area is swollen and warm.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2202	[what]
chapter1_day3_event2_3e356080		With the number of drugs my father wanted to test on me, it was better to have a direct line to the heart than to dig around my arms looking for IV access in between scar tissue.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2214	[what]
chapter1_day3_event2_b2072a71		Obviously, I'd rather not touch it at all.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2221	[what]

chapter1_day3_event3_6b15b2d3		So Mariko's still scraping together her squad. And with that, I get an awful idea.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2273	[what]
chapter1_day3_event3_ef550a69		A whole bunch of manic girls chattering about school spirit and teamwork would be her living nightmare.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2281	[what]

chapter1_day3_event_night_4b82f810		A week after we ran away, we realized he only brought a few things in his backpack. He said it was because he forgot when we were leaving.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2324	[what]
chapter1_day3_event_night_7fafbad8		That's when Lethe asked if he left a note.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2325	[what]
chapter1_day3_event_night_ff32d496		He was too scared to grab his stuff, of course he didn't leave a note. I emptied out one of my pistols and lent it to him so he could feel safe.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2331	[what]
chapter1_day3_event_night_5c7c52f3		Odori even checked the cylinder to make sure. The house should have been empty when he went.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2332	[what]

chapter1_day4_event1_282f1fec		Yeah, but if he knew everything Odori and I knew, I don't think he'd have followed along with our plans.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2411	[what]
chapter1_day4_event1_7649f8d0		I hand him a colorful novel with a Naga Ranger cover. His excitement is extinguished the moment he opens it.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2447	[what]
chapter1_day4_event1_7bda63c9		What's that supposed to mean? As vast as the collection is, there is quite a number of fictional books.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2455	[what]
chapter1_day4_event1_8433a2b5		And I've even found something from his favorite series. It seems I'll have to find something else to hold his attention.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2459	[what]
chapter1_day4_event2_2b2df033		I didn't think too many people would be interested in clubs, especially with so few students here.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2467	[what]

chapter1_day4_event2_87f2d7c9		She’s not terribly fast, but she makes up for it by shouting as she walks.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2509	[what]
chapter1_day4_event2_33a17a47		Oh no. That's not good.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2534	[what]

chapter1_day4_event2_21b83afe		The Education Collar was never meant to do that kind of damage. There shouldn't have been anything in it that could do that.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2597	[what]
chapter1_day4_event2_0fbb67ff		Leave it to Hiro to just side step around a heavy topic.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2603	[what]
chapter1_day4_event2_e6f96c48		He soldiers on, and eventually her mood lightens.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2615	[what]
chapter1_day4_event2_71ec9f2d		She pulls out a crumpled piece of paper from her backpack.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2627	[what]
chapter1_day4_event2_a4ef99e0		All things considered, it seems she has more than enough people to form her club.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2628	[what]
chapter1_day4_event2_03838030		She collects his signature and leaves with a small smile on her face.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2637	[what]

chapter1_day4_event_night_90628b31		At least, for me it feels normal.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2704	[what]
chapter1_day4_event_night_032d263d		None of the kids really wanted to hang out with the 'teacher's pet'.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2705	[what]
chapter1_day4_event_night_0ea24652		The things I wanted to talk about didn't make sense to other kids and I couldn't figure out how to find common ground.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2706	[what]

chapter1_day4_event_night_acba0cb7		No matter how much I fought or yelled, he'd just smile at me like whatever we were fighting over wasn't a big deal.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2715	[what]
chapter1_day4_event_night_4f82fcb2		It frustrated the hell out of me that I couldn't shake him.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2716	[what]
chapter1_day4_event_night_c828793f		Our arguments got so bad, the school had to get involved.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2717	[what]

chapter1_day4_event_night_b5425459		His face... it was unrecognizable.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2734	[what]
chapter1_day4_event_night_4465ff8f		He wanted me to give him stitches, like I'd seen in a documentary, but bones were broken.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2735	[what]
chapter1_day4_event_night_0d580642		We should have gone to the ER, but he was afraid of getting in trouble.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2736	[what]

chapter1_day5_event_morning_6863599a		For the first time since school began, I wake up to the radio blaring at top volume.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2767	[what]
chapter1_day5_event_morning_3afa5f1e		I drag myself out of bed and remind myself it's just one more day of classes before the weekend.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2775	[what]
chapter1_day5_event1_a0428a80		I’m on my way to lunch when I catch Kitsune in the halls.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2783	[what]
chapter1_day5_event1_48266e4d		She has her locker wide open with an assortment of compacts at her feet.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2784	[what]
chapter1_day5_event1_eca2892f		She keeps pulling at her bangs and making wild faces in the mirror.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2785	[what]
chapter1_day5_event1_435220f6		Maybe I could sneak past her if I just-	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2786	[what]
chapter1_day5_event1_735724c0		Damn it.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2792	[what]
chapter1_day5_event1_f94e7bb0		Her voice doesn't carry the same saccharine tone it usually holds.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2796	[what]
chapter1_day5_event1_7cbe6a16		Still, growing up with Uitto, I've come to recognize a loaded question when I hear it.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2797	[what]
chapter1_day5_event1_06398373		She sighs.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2808	[what]
chapter1_day5_event1_5ebf808f		She bends down and picks up her discarded makeup, muttering something about needing more highlighter.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2816	[what]
chapter1_day5_event1_135b3584		She smacks the top of her head on the locker as she stands.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2820	[what]
chapter1_day5_event1_8806e33e		She cuts herself off, unable to think of a reasonable defense.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2830	[what]

chapter1_day5_event2_03830c93		I still have a little time before lunch. For some reason, there’s something bothering me about the cheerleaders.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2854	[what]
chapter1_day5_event2_4f90028d		Rei might still be mad at me, so my best option is Setsuna.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2855	[what]
chapter1_day5_event2_43810322		She shows me her fresh piercings; a bright red star within a glittered bead.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2867	[what]
chapter1_day5_event2_73a82e39		Inside was a pinpoint dot that easily could be mistaken for the stem of the earring.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2868	[what]
chapter1_day5_event2_9c6ed159		I can't explain exactly why, but I feel like she's someone I can trust to look into this.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2899	[what]
chapter1_day5_event2_ee3ce9c3		At least she seems to buy my excuse.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2900	[what]
chapter1_day5_event3_e84f89f8		Uitto storms toward me as soon as the bell rings.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2914	[what]
chapter1_day5_event3_12c320ca		Uh oh.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2918	[what]
chapter1_day5_event3_02f011ad		I really shouldn't laugh, but I can't help it.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2930	[what]
chapter1_day5_event3_c8bfccdc		She always says stuff like that, but that was when she still had Odori to rely on.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2953	[what]
chapter1_day5_event3_27f0e40e		Lately she seems to be pushing everyone away indiscriminately.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2954	[what]
chapter1_day5_event3_8683f61d		Sure enough, there’s not a single hole.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2980	[what]
chapter1_day5_event3_4c64ce6a		Never in a million years have I misremembered something. What's wrong with me?	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	2988	[what]
chapter1_day5_event4_3ddd8440		Jona and I are on the way to the cafeteria when we run into Uitto.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	3000	[what]
chapter1_day5_event4_45bb56b5		She seems scared.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	3004	[what]
chapter1_day5_event4_975832e1		I haven't seen him all day. I just assumed Uitto had been with him instead.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	3018	[what]
chapter1_day5_event4_9fc07be6		Unease settles into my stomach as I dial his number on my burner phone. No answer.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	3019	[what]
chapter1_day5_event4_761cd3e8		Uitto goes pale.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	3023	[what]
chapter1_day5_event4_8154745a		Before I can get a word in, they run off. By now, he should be at the field where we were supposed to surrender.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	3037	[what]
chapter1_day5_event4_d7db53c6		The question is, who's behind this?	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	3038	[what]
chapter1_day5_event_night_011fe207		Uitto’s carrying her pillow under her arm and a few bags of chips in the other. She looks like she’s ready for bed.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	3048	[what]
chapter1_day5_event_night_699890a1		Everyone crams themselves into my tiny dorm. Because, of course, after only a week of being here, I have the cleanest room.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	3090	[what]
chapter1_day5_event_night_3de87306		We fight to find an outlet for the TV, opting to balance it on a pile of textbooks so everyone can see.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	3091	[what]
chapter1_day5_event_night_822975e5		I slide the tape in and watch as static peels away to reveal a grainy image of a familiar logo.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	3099	[what]
chapter1_day5_event_night_fb63873b		The video is consumed by static once more.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	3105	[what]
chapter1_day5_event_night_d5b4067e		None of that explains how they found us, or why they didn't target us directly. And that name...	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	3115	[what]
chapter1_day5_event_night_e6edf793		The tape sputters and then a curtain displays on the screen. Slowly a girl, suspended by ribbons, is lowered into the frame.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	3129	[what]
chapter1_day5_event_night_91061fa9		She disappears behind the static. We sit there drowning in white noise for a few moments before Uitto turns off the TV.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	3165	[what]
chapter1_day5_event_night_83d62d8e		We marathon B-grade movies long into the night. The next day, we find out that Mariko won’t be coming back to class for a long time.	game/chapter_one_events.rpy	3191	[what]
YokuInv1_e32012b8		I freeze, foot in the air, with the door to the stage half open.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	9	[what]
YokuInv1_5a8e578a		The floor is littered from end to end with carefully overlapped pieces of sheet music.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	10	[what]
YokuInv1_7610c6c5		I slowly open the door and find a safe place to stand.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	11	[what]
YokuInv1_5a024f0a		Yoku is in the center of it, a little more disheveled than usual.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	12	[what]
YokuInv1_0ba4261d		I’m trying so hard to keep a straight face, but I think he can hear me stifling a laugh.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	29	[what]
YokuInvestigation1_90a6721a		A ringtone maybe?	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	49	[what]
YokuInvestigation1_022cbe46		He looks up unamused.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	53	[what]
YokuInvestigation1_5fadf079		I show Yoku a photo I took of the CDs	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	72	[what]

YokuInvestigation1_4d73c340		Shit, I better get out of here.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	110	[what]
ReiInv1_a4eda1f7		Rei might not want to talk to me, but if I want a clear picture, I need to talk to everyone.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	121	[what]
ReiInv1_f71dde39		I find Rei practicing her old floor routine on the outdoor stage.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	122	[what]
ReiInv1_eff7b1cb		She juggles her plastic sword mechanically, focusing on throwing it as high as she can.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	123	[what]
ReiInv1_dd999780		Normally she moves with more grace and joy.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	124	[what]
ReiInv1_4cb1af6b		She catches her blade one last time, but refuses to look at me.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	128	[what]
ReiInv1_e27522da		I think that's as close as I'll get to a yes.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	134	[what]
ReiInv1_9172bc0a		There are definitely people here I could have gone my whole life without seeing again.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	177	[what]
ReiInv1_55da8bb2		I don't think there's anything I can say to make this right, but...	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	178	[what]
ReiInv1_2d4d7e33		I didn't realize how close Rei felt to everyone.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	188	[what]
ReiInv1_6c4c3fd8		Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to have someone this loyal on my side.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	189	[what]
ReiInterrogation1_eb370c9b		Rei would know best if Mariko's acting odd. Still, there's a high chance this is all coincidence.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	225	[what]
ReiInterrogation1_ab50a2d2		Why is she acting so defensive?	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	252	[what]
ReiInterrogation1_b5a1b975		But not without permission. Whoever it was, they must be close to Kazz and Rei.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	258	[what]
ReiInterrogation1_09a958af		Still, it wouldn't be hard to leave a note on his dorm or something.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	270	[what]
ReiInterrogation1_59fa324b		Even she doesn't seem totally convinced by that explanation.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	277	[what]
ReiInterrogation1_02287b62		She's really not happy about it though.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	304	[what]
ReiInterrogation1_1ddfb5e6		To a Vigor Major like her, maybe it's not.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	317	[what]
ReiInterrogation1_5da445e3		She hesitates and fumbles with her baton.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	321	[what]
ReiInterrogation1_be91ed30		Vigor Majors can be almost inhuman sometimes.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	344	[what]
MomokoInv1_dbcd7142		Momoko's music is so loud I can hear it down the hall.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	356	[what]
MomokoInv1_95d8b585		I peer in through the window to make sure she isn't handling any chemicals before opening the door.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	357	[what]
MomokoInv1_b0b92f26		No good, she can't hear me.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	361	[what]
MomokoInv1_22b900c6		I flick one of the light switches on and off.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	362	[what]
MomokoInv1_f3feebc6		She jumps, but the minute she sees me a huge smile spreads across her face.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	363	[what]
MomokoInv1_c30e7870		I can see her lips moving, but all I hear is the music.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	364	[what]
MomokoInv1_bbea7955		Click.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	368	[what]
MomokoInterrogation1_692c2a4c		Right, the skates. It's probably a pain to take them off every time she wants to go to a different floor.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	400	[what]
MomokoInterrogation1_9a91b420		I show Momoko the computer.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	410	[what]
MomokoInterrogation1_87310731		She grabs the beaker with a set of tongs and moves it toward the fume hood.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	452	[what]
MomokoInterrogation1_42c9416a		I plunge the room into darkness and the fire dissipates.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	456	[what]
MomokoInterrogation1_3d8f258a		I should probably go.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	462	[what]
RiseInv1_5c31ce34		I find Rise enjoying a cup of tea in the courtyard.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	469	[what]
RiseInv1_7a13ab63		How does she manage to flip the script so quickly?	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	479	[what]
RiseInv1_dc2e11cd		Uitto could care less about who was cleaning erasers and checking attendance logs.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	484	[what]
RiseInv1_2ec92e85		However, she's not too keen on people telling her what to do.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	485	[what]
RiseInterrogation1_0e4e148e		She raises a solitary hand and waits for me to close my mouth.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	517	[what]
RiseInterrogation1_ef2fbb0e		Is she... rooting for me?	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	580	[what]
RiseInterrogation1_98ee8c1f		If so, she has a strange way of showing it.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	581	[what]
RiseInterrogation1_0c31f051		She packs up her set into an old cigar box with a sigh.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	582	[what]
RiseInterrogation1_8d8c4c59		With that, she leaves.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	589	[what]
NanaseInv1_dd543ebf		Nanase was more than happy to meet with me, but she told me she was working on something at the cafe.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	596	[what]
NanaseInv1_585fd1a2		I arrive to find various ingredients out, with tinny music playing from a burner phone.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	597	[what]
NanaseInv1_3c147a44		Nanase is running around from table to book to fridge covered in what smells like cocoa powder.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	598	[what]
NanaseInv1_7a120ed2		She points to a mounted security camera.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	609	[what]
NanaseInv1_b6dd40c4		Creepy. She’s about to dust herself off when she looks up.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	613	[what]
NanaseInv1_a1884bf9		She looks over at a decimated carton on the far left table with obvious disappointment.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	623	[what]
NanaseInterrogation1_8728d611		I showed her the announcement list	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	660	[what]
NanaseInterrogation1_35cbb57d		It's so weird to think the announcement pissed off people who weren't even involved.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	700	[what]
NanaseInterrogation1_6e70e6fa		I wonder if there are others who felt threatened by it.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	701	[what]
KietsuInv1_a9a483d9		I find Kietsu buried under a pile of paperwork.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	712	[what]
KietsuInv1_8f8f9ff3		Everything is sorted into color-coded piles, but chaotically so.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	713	[what]
KietsuInv1_763ba7ae		Every few seconds, he pauses to write something on a stray sticky note.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	714	[what]
KietsuInv1_f4efcd79		No response. He must really be in the zone.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	720	[what]
KietsuInv1_ae326cf0		I turn to leave, but opening the door catches his attention.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	721	[what]
KietsuInterogation1_f467979d		Kazz doesn't seem like the type to let people in.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	765	[what]
KietsuInterogation1_38468f2d		It might be a good idea to check with the others.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	766	[what]
KietsuInterogation1_ef3ef379		There's really no way to question people about this without sounding paranoid as all get out. Doesn't seem to bother him much though.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	792	[what]
KietsuInterogation1_ca3cd91b		For a second there, he sounded so grown up.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	823	[what]
KietsuInterogation1_233de58b		But just as quickly, his gaze wanders and he starts fretting over the disorganized piles on his desk.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	824	[what]
KietsuInterogation1_3a56edec		I guess they really do need all the help they can get.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	835	[what]
KietsuInterogation1_c7fe38ca		Still, it's nice to know not everyone thinks I'm a monster on sight.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	836	[what]
KietsuInterogation1_e7a6ae22		There's still more people I have to see.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	842	[what]
TaigaInv1_74f5fe6b		I find Taiga doing stretches in the courtyard.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	853	[what]
TaigaInv1_a7364f3d		Next to him is a wide pen for his rabbits to enjoy the fresh air.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	854	[what]
TaigaInv1_4dcd45f9		It's strange to see him this awake.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	855	[what]
TaigaInterrogation1_29a37774		Isn't that extortion? Surely the school would have given her space to store club stuff if she asked.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	898	[what]
TaigaInterrogation1_3a923dca		Why go so far to rent someone else's locker?	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	899	[what]
TaigaInterrogation1_ed332463		I showed him the CDs	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	911	[what]
TaigaInterrogation1_07d97cc4		He has a point though. It's odd someone would make a move like that in front of the faculty.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	926	[what]
TaigaInterrogation1_c31ef59e		Why wouldn't they try to be more secretive about it?	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	927	[what]
DyreInv1_120b3498		Technically, students aren't supposed to come to areas that are under construction.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	959	[what]
DyreInv1_3c6bcff3		But since the roof's unlocked, some people have been treating it like free game.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	960	[what]
DyreInv1_f6d89222		Dyre is one of those people. He’s dragging old beat-up furniture around a stack of busted palettes, just out of eye-line from the stairs.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	961	[what]
DyreInv1_e80f5fb8		He jolts, then relaxes a bit when he sees me.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	967	[what]
DyreInv1_4847333f		Dyre's a master at throwing me down rabbit holes when I come looking for something else.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	976	[what]
DyreInv1_6685cc24		I gotta stay focused.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	977	[what]
DyreInterrogation1_aa55f261		He says with a knowing smile, then sighs.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1003	[what]
DyreInterrogation1_819f0197		What a liar!	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1038	[what]
DyreInterrogation1_de606138		But, if he's willing to cover for them, it might be someone he's close to.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1039	[what]
DyreInterrogation1_5950e78e		At the very least, I know it's not him.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1040	[what]
DyreInterrogation1_4a1808f9		By this point, Dyre has completely abandoned his attempt to rearrange the roof.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1065	[what]
DyreInterrogation1_6c47b4b8		He regards me with the same amount of intrigue and confusion one might have toward a foreign commercial.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1066	[what]
DyreInterrogation1_6886f80f		Honestly, I don't know what to say. He doesn't even look that mad.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1075	[what]
DyreInterrogation1_742dd1da		He brushes past me, leaving me alone on the roof.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1087	[what]
DyreInterrogation1_c7a9f9e0		Just who does he think he is anyway? I can't let him get to me.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1088	[what]
DyreInterrogation1_841b7953		I should leave before I get caught.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1089	[what]
ChiseiInv1_840bfd87		Chisei is puttering around the stage with a tape measure and a package of chalk.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1097	[what]
ChiseiInv1_25c5e3f7		She has a piece on the ground and is trying to drag it along the ground with the ball of her foot.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1098	[what]
ChiseiInv1_2accf462		I pick up the chalk.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1109	[what]
ChiseiInv1_da3dc17f		Before I can hand it to her, she points at the ground.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1110	[what]
ChiseiInterrogation1_f99b5250		I think most people find loud noises upsetting.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1158	[what]
ChiseiInterrogation1_6f9c4bc3		Especially when they come out of nowhere in the middle of the night.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1159	[what]
ChiseiInterrogation1_f4a8b334		I show her the announcement list.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1165	[what]
ChiseiInterrogation1_b53d9a69		She bites her lip, looking at the string of lines we made on the stage.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1187	[what]
ChiseiInterrogation1_5b932df6		She holds up her left hand with a frown.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1194	[what]
ChiseiInterrogation1_6008b851		Her sudden burst of energy catches me off guard and I can’t help myself; I laugh.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1227	[what]
ChiseiInterrogation1_79b007ac		I came here looking for answers, but Chisei ended up cheering me up instead.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1233	[what]
ShomaInv1_4ae4425b		Shoma is in his hovel of a sewing room.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1241	[what]
ShomaInv1_9f9bbfc8		The place is a little more organized than before, but strung up lights can't block out the dungeon vibe I get whenever I walk in.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1242	[what]
ShomaInv1_975fcd43		What the- Where did that come from?	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1246	[what]
ShomaInv1_d754229c		This guy's definition of normal and my definition are wildly different.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1256	[what]
ShomaInterrogation1_630dead1		He groans.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1271	[what]
ShomaInterrogation1_ab3cec04		I can practically hear a cash register go off in his mind.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1284	[what]
ShomaInterrogation1_9cd2a1d5		That explains how someone could sneak around at night without getting noticed. I wonder who he's fighting with.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1292	[what]
ShomaInterrogation1_d5b90158		I showed Shoma a pictture of the computer.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1298	[what]
ShomaInterrogation1_3fa906df		I thought Kazz was the only one that managed to smuggle stuff in.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1304	[what]
ShomaInterrogation1_9a2ad7d3		He turned his head toward the door.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1310	[what]
ShomaInterrogation1_d9389d59		I'm starting to think Setsuna should be worried about getting spied on and not the other way around.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1324	[what]
ShomaInterrogation1_ebe6b4cf		So anyone logged into the same account can give it commands.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1329	[what]
ShomaInterrogation1_8dcc06f1		That's good to know. There was no login page in the computer's history and I doubt that someone would leave behind the search history if they were covering their tracks.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1330	[what]
ShomaInterrogation1_a835aaf6		They must have some other way to log in.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1331	[what]
ShomaInterrogation1_9c311eee		I think I've gotten everything I can get from him. I best get moving.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1378	[what]
IchitaInv1_2d4776ed		I find Ichita by the large pond behind the amphitheater.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1386	[what]
IchitaInv1_a7af24e9		He’s sitting on the dock and staring into the water intently.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1387	[what]
IchitaInv1_e945e7b2		It’s so murky, you can’t see the bottom, but every now and then, I swear I see a fish.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1388	[what]
IchitaInv1_ced442f3		At least ducks think it’s safe to land on.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1389	[what]
IchitaInv1_6f04f8fa		He lays back on the dock, his legs dangling over the edge.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1400	[what]
IchitaInterrogation1_7bf1bb05		Now I'm not going to be able to shake that feeling of being watched.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1449	[what]
IchitaInterrogation1_1d3e4991		Please god, don't let there be a camera in my room.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1457	[what]
IchitaInterrogation1_d5c79854		I asked Nagen about the missing phone.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1463	[what]
IchitaInterrogation1_62bda140		...Is that why he's out here?	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1499	[what]
IchitaInterrogation1_c16ad0ed		I can barely fit my backpack into my locker, but I don't think it's a good idea to bring that up.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1511	[what]
IchitaInterrogation1_b431578e		He still doesn't get up.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1517	[what]
IchitaInterrogation1_c9fd1d55		Damn, that was fast. I should go now.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1523	[what]
SetsunaInv1_2090b404		Setsuna can really be hard to find when she wants to be. Which I guess in her case, would be all the time.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1535	[what]
SetsunaInv1_03f86e51		I find her outside the cafe surveying the flora with a wrinkled nose.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1536	[what]
SetsunaInv1_722bc998		The overgrowth around her is waist high. I hardly consider them weeds.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1549	[what]
SetsunaInv1_8e8b1066		At this point, they are the grounds. She shakes her head.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1550	[what]
SetsunaInterrogation1_de9a9473		She groans into her hands.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1572	[what]
SetsunaInterrogation1_d0f9dd24		And yet she can't understand why people think she's biased.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1587	[what]
SetsunaInterrogation1_59bd89fc		People forget their passwords all the time, but if they had access to something that already had access...	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1610	[what]
SetsunaInterrogation1_70e7a955		That sure sounds like Kazz's phone alright. I should let him know where it is. 	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1639	[what]
SetsunaInterrogation1_89b9060f		Hard to believe the bar is that low at this point. I'd sooner believe no one else is interested.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1659	[what]
SetsunaInterrogation1_30f7c543		She turns her attention back to the overgrowth.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1676	[what]
KitsuneInv1_eb31396d		I find Kitsune in the library with her head down on one of the desks.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1688	[what]
KitsuneInv1_94d394fe		She usually seems so put together, or at least, she tries really hard to seem that way. For a moment, I’m seriously worried.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1689	[what]
KitsuneInv1_a71a7455		She kicks at a pair of abandoned heels.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1699	[what]
KitsuneInv1_db344cb8		There's no way Mu would hand me meds unless he was there to watch me take it.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1707	[what]
KitsuneInv1_2f5011f5		But Jona usually carries all kinds of stuff in his pockets.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1708	[what]
KitsuneInv1_1c63fded		I return with a ziplock bag and a 'no questions asked' debt to Jona.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1714	[what]
KitsuneInv1_495fbeb6		Kitsune accepts it with abundant appreciation.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1715	[what]
KitsuneInv1_cc5224c6		Yeah, she's definitely feeling better.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1719	[what]
KitsuneInterrogation1_d5940951		Why do I get the feeling I'm going to regret asking this?	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1729	[what]
KitsuneInterrogation1_dfd137cb		I don't think she'd care.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1737	[what]
KitsuneInterrogation1_68ee4417		It wouldn't be hard to tip an anxious person like him over the edge as a distraction.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1772	[what]
KitsuneInterrogation1_08db77b2		But I can't ignore that Kitsune has a personal reason for wanting to keep him out of trouble.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1773	[what]
KitsuneInterrogation1_c054fc44		She bites her lip.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1786	[what]
KitsuneInterrogation1_da8e8c99		Maybe she knows something about him I don't.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1802	[what]
KitsuneInterrogation1_334ab88c		As far as I can tell, he's one of the most trusting people here.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1803	[what]
KitsuneInterrogation1_84a7328a		She gently tugs at her hair, threading her thumbs through her pigtails.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1813	[what]
KitsuneInterrogation1_53502d48		I think something's still bothering her.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1814	[what]
KitsuneInterrogation1_ac465a25		A number of things come to mind, none of them good.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1834	[what]
KitsuneInterrogation1_92d73588		She carefully puts on her heels and sighs.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1839	[what]
KitsuneInterrogation1_fccb479a		She hobbles out of the room and leaves me behind.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1845	[what]
KitsuneInterrogation1_5f770fcf		I’m the only one left in the library.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1846	[what]
MuInv1_c7365acc		It's weird seeing Mu outside of the nurse's office.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1852	[what]
MuInv1_cb4a4766		I mean, I know he's a student here, but I assumed he'd spend his free time hiding in a corner getting high.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1853	[what]
MuInv1_8689e5d5		He’s sitting at the stone table when I find him and looks up from his burner phone at me in surprise.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1854	[what]
MuInv1_f9f40809		Hit a little too close to home I see.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1864	[what]
MuInv1_5398aed5		He gestures at the seat across from him. I take that as an open invitation.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1871	[what]
MuInv1_80038a53		It never ceases to amaze me how small I feel next to this guy, even when he's sitting down.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1877	[what]
MuInterrogation1_0fbc3a67		So the Echo was already in the booth by the time club submissions were open.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1920	[what]
MuInterrogation1_e37bac9a		That means anyone who could get in the booth would have access to it.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1921	[what]
MuInterrogation1_af46eabf		When I show him the search history, his face darkens.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1929	[what]
MuInterrogation1_aeca2ff7		He shakes his head.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1935	[what]
MuInterrogation1_8d8d7b70		He's absolutely covering for someone.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1940	[what]
MuInterrogation1_c5fccf1d		I don't think he'll tell me who, but he might be able to confirm something else.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1941	[what]
MuInterrogation1_11e890d6		I think it's fair to say that someone he's close with is involved.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1962	[what]
MuInterrogation1_36c2aebf		Well, that's more than I was expecting.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1967	[what]
MuInterrogation1_59398b80		He gets up to leave.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1979	[what]
KazzInv1_c706a090		It takes a while to track down Kazz.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1989	[what]
KazzInv1_af8c3d78		Everyone I‘ve talked to has seen him running all over campus.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1990	[what]
KazzInv1_d36ae9b3		When I finally find him, he’s lying on the ground with his arms shoved under a broken couch.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1991	[what]
KazzInv1_e0d64b2a		He rolls onto his back and sits up.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1997	[what]
KazzInv1_947df55c		His hair is a mess and his hat got lost in the folds of his hoodie.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	1998	[what]
KazzInv1_df4f5efa		I guess I'm not the only one struggling to rebuild their image.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2025	[what]
KazzInv1_618e1993		He's the one who brought up getting framed though.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2032	[what]
KazzInterrogation1_d5b8fd71		I'll try asking one of them.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2053	[what]
KazzInterrogation1_56433afb		Everything's a mess right now, but the bottom line is Kazz's 'friends' were the ones running off with his stuff.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2074	[what]
KazzInterrogation1_b4bb556f		He hands me a foil card in a plastic sleeve.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2079	[what]
KazzInterrogation1_b6f414ff		I had to leave my old collection behind when I ran away from home.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2089	[what]
KazzInterrogation1_9a0ac623		Maybe I should try collecting them again.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2090	[what]
KazzInterrogation1_280001f5		That thing's basically a skeleton key for everything he owns.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2123	[what]
KazzInterrogation1_41270c2a		Even so, maybe Dyre has done other things to mess with Kazz. I'll have to give it a look.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2183	[what]
KazzInterrogation1_b91a0047		And that could be anyone.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2202	[what]
KazzInterrogation1_255767ce		That means anyone I saw in the halls...	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2221	[what]
KazzInterrogation1_657282a4		It would have been impossible to make it back in time without being out of breath.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2225	[what]
KazzInterrogation1_e5d1ba7f		Rei, Mu, Yoku, Dyre, Taiga, Ichita and Chisei... they're not the one's responsible.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2230	[what]
KazzInterrogation1_cb4b7b38		All the school rules have clearly defined consequences except that one and the way it's worded is weird.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2258	[what]
KazzInterrogation1_2a259eea		To be honest, I'm not too concerned with what a couple of teachers would do.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2265	[what]
KazzInterrogation1_9852faa1		Especially when they've been acting like nothing happened.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2266	[what]
KazzInterrogation1_0880ca53		He shoves his hands in his pockets and leaves without another word.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2275	[what]
KazzInterrogation1_d87b6154		Does he think I'm not going to fight or does he just not care what happens to me? Whatever, I got what I needed anyway.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2276	[what]
MarikoInv1_596797d2		I find Mariko in the art room. She has various pencils and markers scattered about the table.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2287	[what]
MarikoInv1_9013ab5f		Scraps of paper litter the floor and she seems to be pasting together various concepts for posters.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2288	[what]
MarikoInv1_e7ed2041		She visibly jumps and looks over at me with wide eyes.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2292	[what]
MarikoInv1_ec79afc4		I gesture to the looming piles of art supplies.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2299	[what]
MarikoInv1_4760a3ab		She holds up a sticky page, one of the shapes getting slowly pulled down by the weight of gravity.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2303	[what]
MarikoInv1_3a780081		It’s certainly eye-catching, which I guess is the goal so...	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2304	[what]
MarikoInv1_2bda7c58		I clear a spot for myself under her watchful eye.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2315	[what]
MarikoChoice1_be1b2bb9		Mariko falters and looks away.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2336	[what]
MarikoChoice1_f9d23a86		She refused to look at me the entire time she spoke.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2352	[what]
MarikoOutro_7db69002		I guess that's why she's working on posters alone.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2371	[what]
MarikoOutro_71722565		If I stick around any longer, I'll get roped into making posters for a club I'm not in. I should go.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2384	[what]
MarikoInt_183623a2		Between what everyone’s been seeing, and how she's been acting, I'm sure she's behind the PA Incident.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2395	[what]
MarikoInt_8049b556		However, it’s too soon to get her to admit it, especially with how defensive she’s been lately.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2396	[what]
MarikoInt_50b07f28		If I want her to talk, I should ask her about something innocuous; something that would connect her to the recording booth without sounding like an accusation.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2397	[what]
MarikoInt_5d2f6604		No good. I'll have to work backwards then and show proof someone thinks they're close to her.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2408	[what]
Mariko1_806a36ad		She's trying to downplay their connection, but it explains some things.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2418	[what]
Mariko1_662ac52d		If they knew each other before, it's make sense that he'd want to impress her.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2419	[what]
Mariko2_7345de7e		I'm positive the recording device was Kazz's.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2442	[what]
Mariko3A_285b4be3		Now that's just a bold-faced lie.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2471	[what]
Mariko3B_3fd5906e		Without it, there'd be no way for her to have used the PA mic without getting caught.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2539	[what]
Mariko4B_55f34990		Seems like she's counting on that to be her alibi, however...	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2559	[what]
Mariko4B_ec43626b		Interesting she brought her up, since their stories contradict each other.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2565	[what]
Mariko5B_d9fd65ce		She's just going to keep denying stuff until I spell it out for her. I know for a fact it didn't go 'straight to the teachers'.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2593	[what]
Mariko5B_00bd0596		Multiple people have said as much.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2594	[what]
Mariko6B_0bfb2566		She's ringing her hands quite a bit. Doesn't seem like she has anything to say to that.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2612	[what]
MarikoSuccess_79145a0b		For a moment, her bravado falters.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2690	[what]
MarikoSuccess_f9d38d2f		Of course, there's no telling how much mileage I can get out of this afterward.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2715	[what]
MarikoSuccess_30302810		She shivers, gaunt and ghostly pale.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2731	[what]
MarikoSuccess_c2993c08		There's no way that's going to happen.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2736	[what]
MarikoSuccess_81ef93d3		Even if she was successful, the DVP wouldn't let unaccompanied minors disappear like that.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2737	[what]
MarikoSuccess_70db8d72		She covers her earrings with her pompoms and keeps darting her eyes between me and the paper in front of her...	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2753	[what]
MarikoSuccess_600fd8b7		Is she wearing cameras? I scribble the message down and hold it up. She nods. Who would do something like this?	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2754	[what]
MarikoSuccess_a3fce661		Mariko hands me an unmarked VHS tape from her bag.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2759	[what]
MarikoSuccess_882b845b		I should wait until I'm with everyone to watch this.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2766	[what]
MarikoSuccess_5dbea868		She collects her stuff with a solemn look on her face.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2767	[what]
MarikoFail_892327b3		She gathers up her supplies with a glare.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2781	[what]
UittoInv1_dbb81b40		I ask Uitto if she was able to dig up anything.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2798	[what]
JonaInv1_15d518cf		Jona doesn't really like talking to people alone, so I appreciate he was willing to do this for me.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2831	[what]
HiroInv1_b58c4b22		I felt a little nervous sending Hiro out on his own. Still, he insisted and when he returned...	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2862	[what]
HiroInv1_a6758ceb		I shouldn't be too surprised, but I thought Hiro was friends with everyone.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2870	[what]
HiroInv1_e38157b1		I guess even he has his limit.	game/chapter_one_investigation.rpy	2871	[what]
prologue_cfb01f82		My whole life, I feel like I've been dragged around by my collar.	game/prologue.rpy	8	[what]
prologue_94b869b2		I guess when most adults see a kid act out of line, they're overwhelmed with a need to control the situation.	game/prologue.rpy	9	[what]
prologue_f67843bc		Funny, seeing as that's the very thing I've been fighting for: a chance to be in control of my life.	game/prologue.rpy	10	[what]
prologue_54cf487d		I tap the side of my head.	game/prologue.rpy	24	[what]
prologue_8794ae86		Having a great memory doesn't really make me smarter than anyone else, but the ability falls under the Intelligence major.	game/prologue.rpy	25	[what]
prologue_36f719e8		People are just so determined to classify things so they can feel important, they stop asking whether it's worth the effort.	game/prologue.rpy	26	[what]
prologue_49f89903		I mean, some people can go their whole lives without realizing they have a Proficiency.	game/prologue.rpy	27	[what]
prologue_995345bc		It's nothing special. The only reason I know about mine is because I was groomed to have it.	game/prologue.rpy	28	[what]
prologue_bcaf1d40		Remember? No one is truly capable of remembering.	game/prologue.rpy	63	[what]
prologue_238805b9		Well, if you want to get technical, remembering is just being aware of something.	game/prologue.rpy	64	[what]
prologue_ba6eeff6		But people seem to think that it means they can recall the past in perfect clarity, ignorant of how time and their own perception taints everything that enters their mind.	game/prologue.rpy	65	[what]
prologue_9eb7ad54		These hypocritical drones are spitting on the name of the very woman they worshiped six months ago.	game/prologue.rpy	66	[what]
prologue_b1b99bf6		People treat her like she was some kind of psychopath, incapable of feeling anything for anyone.	game/prologue.rpy	67	[what]
prologue_cf0d4ecc		Sure she had a Messiah Complex toward the end, but it's not like she didn't care about other people entirely.	game/prologue.rpy	68	[what]
prologue_5da47d54		I mean, she was the leader of the Karmic Gladiators; she devoted her life to helping people that everyone thought couldn't be helped.	game/prologue.rpy	69	[what]
prologue_9faa02f4		She was everyone's hero, especially mine...	game/prologue.rpy	70	[what]
prologue_c23548db		I started gathering the draft papers, but when I looked up at her face, she seemed so sad.	game/prologue.rpy	104	[what]
prologue_4011a5e4		She took a seat at the table in silence.	game/prologue.rpy	105	[what]
prologue_33cf6e54		I became painfully aware of the IV that hid under my sleeve.	game/prologue.rpy	120	[what]
prologue_1b32022f		Had she noticed it? Was she going to tell anyone?	game/prologue.rpy	121	[what]
prologue_b36246c3		If anyone found out, I could be taken away, or worse. What if she had already told someone?	game/prologue.rpy	122	[what]
prologue_92525e0d		We all choked out an empty yes, but she wasn't satisfied.	game/prologue.rpy	123	[what]
prologue_9d0c782c		She wanted to make sure I was safe when she left that room and somehow, she knew I had been lying.	game/prologue.rpy	124	[what]
prologue_b3e6a200		All of us had, and it wouldn't surprise me if she had taken the others aside as well.	game/prologue.rpy	125	[what]
prologue_9d23fbad		In her name, we fought for sanctuary from Estella Academy and the people who abused us.	game/prologue.rpy	126	[what]
prologue_565a7719		The brainwashing of our peers was a little excessive, I'll admit, but how else would you be able to safely train middle schoolers for a civil war?	game/prologue.rpy	127	[what]
prologue_bc724299		We didn't have the luxury to make a boot camp with the city up in flames.	game/prologue.rpy	128	[what]
prologue_72641c3c		We worked with what we had, in the time we had…	game/prologue.rpy	129	[what]
prologue_1d1e0ed4		But that was the me of two years ago, the kid who grew up in a glass box waiting for my veins to stop burning.	game/prologue.rpy	135	[what]
prologue_796a1179		The unwilling test subject of the very people who stand before me claiming I'm the monster.	game/prologue.rpy	136	[what]

life_1_57d54dd4		My mouth's gone dry. I don't want to be here.	game/prologue.rpy	833	[what]
life_1_12fe1137		She should be in a limo on her way to a new home, not me.	game/prologue.rpy	834	[what]

prologue2_f8ec023e		I hate saying it like that.	game/prologue.rpy	1032	[what]
prologue2_5ea63b56		I hate thinking about it like that, but after everything we lost, what we did had to mean something.	game/prologue.rpy	1033	[what]
prologue2_247a3f09		I just got here and he's already lecturing me about how disappointed he is in me.	game/prologue.rpy	1062	[what]
prologue2_5e939e5e		At least we're on the same page about how much I want to be here.	game/prologue.rpy	1063	[what]
prologue2_ff04b462		Great, I'm going to spend the next year getting shuffled around like old luggage.	game/prologue.rpy	1078	[what]

prologue2_2ace0fa6		The room I’ve been given shares a striking resemblance to the one I grew up in as a kid.	game/prologue.rpy	1105	[what]
prologue2_a3c40dea		It’s not quite the same shade of blue and the books are too new to be mine.	game/prologue.rpy	1106	[what]
prologue2_5d287e3d		It’s equally eerie and comforting.	game/prologue.rpy	1107	[what]

prologue2_2c0375f0		Something just seems... off.	game/prologue.rpy	1175	[what]
prologue2_d131bf28		Each classroom has a transparent door with an electronic display built-in.	game/prologue.rpy	1179	[what]

prologue2_ccc495af		I appreciate she’s trying to make this sound like an adventure, but it doesn’t change how... empty the school feels.	game/prologue.rpy	1192	[what]

prologue2_eaae0872		Maimai escorts me into the office.	game/prologue.rpy	1211	[what]
prologue2_db671649		A woman gestures for us to sit down. She takes her place behind a massive desk with a stack of forms for us to review.	game/prologue.rpy	1219	[what]
prologue2_e1a83c3f		The nameplate in front of her reads in gold letters 'Principal Vivaldi Thani'.	game/prologue.rpy	1220	[what]

prologue2_745bb84c		It's like she doesn't even care.	game/prologue.rpy	1233	[what]
prologue2_658b2618		The principal is cold and composed, much like a statue.	game/prologue.rpy	1241	[what]
prologue2_1b7cca75		I can’t help glaring at her. The DVP had handed me over to the woman who set up Lethe and sabotaged our siege of Guwon.	game/prologue.rpy	1242	[what]
prologue2_48b81105		How could she be so indifferent? Doesn’t she recognize me at all?!	game/prologue.rpy	1243	[what]
prologue2_1584fa10		I've never seen Maimai so nervous before.	game/prologue.rpy	1250	[what]

prologue2_ec08d4ca		Locating? Is that what she calls what she did? Locating criminals?	game/prologue.rpy	1261	[what]
prologue2_b85c2df8		Lethe was- She watched them kill her with that indifferent stare on live television.	game/prologue.rpy	1262	[what]
prologue2_2406d68d		We get up to leave. I can’t hold my tongue any longer.	game/prologue.rpy	1263	[what]
prologue2_33a8b086		I practically get pushed out of the room by Maimai.	game/prologue.rpy	1285	[what]
prologue2_fee62043		The wooden doors slam shut, but her hands never leave my shoulders.	game/prologue.rpy	1286	[what]
prologue2_68a61cd9		Each word is slow and deliberate.	game/prologue.rpy	1309	[what]
prologue2_336ed10a		She finishes with a wink and finally I understand.	game/prologue.rpy	1313	[what]
prologue2_a9375cbb		My old teammates could be here too.	game/prologue.rpy	1314	[what]
prologue2_9cdbff2c		Still, to cut me off like that, it must mean I was right.	game/prologue.rpy	1318	[what]
prologue2_71d64546		They’re here. Somewhere in this god-forsaken reform school, I’ll find my friends.	game/prologue.rpy	1319	[what]
prologue2_24360d99		We go back to the car to get the last of my things.	game/prologue.rpy	1326	[what]
prologue2_872144a1		She wraps me in a huge hug and I become very aware of the car coming up to the roundabout.	game/prologue.rpy	1327	[what]
prologue2_86c0a613		I brush her off and collect my bags.	game/prologue.rpy	1337	[what]
prologue2_3ba88260		I really don’t want to go, but I can’t keep putting it off.	game/prologue.rpy	1343	[what]
prologue2_d2fb33cd		We say our final goodbyes and I watch as the car drives off. Tomorrow will be my first day of school.	game/prologue.rpy	1344	[what]
prologue2_13c70d4d		I can see other kids unloading their luggage and milling about the grounds. Now would be a good chance to find my friends.	game/prologue.rpy	1345	[what]
prologue2_c5090d18		Good god man, have you forgotten how to talk to people like a normal human being?	game/prologue.rpy	1364	[what]
prologue2_5e2cebef		Don't just stand there, say something!	game/prologue.rpy	1365	[what]
prologue2_42bbd75b		I motion to my garishly decorated luggage; my guardians said I needed more than my usual duffle bag of necessities.	game/prologue.rpy	1373	[what]
prologue2_69ccb42d		Pretty sure I have more bags than clothes. They would have been a nice way to carry my rifles... had they let me keep them.	game/prologue.rpy	1374	[what]
prologue2_06398373		She sighs.	game/prologue.rpy	1378	[what]
prologue2_6d6d6c56		Did that sound weird? I feel like it sounded super weird.	game/prologue.rpy	1392	[what]
prologue2_df9806e1		I'm drawing a blank. Why did I only get four hours of sleep last night? This is a nightmare.	game/prologue.rpy	1393	[what]
prologue2_421c96c0		103, that'll probably be on the ground floor. I grab my many bags, fumbling a little.	game/prologue.rpy	1399	[what]
prologue2_901985f2		Have I taken too long? I really can handle it, it'll just be a little awkward balancing five bags.	game/prologue.rpy	1403	[what]
prologue2_fb378384		Though now that I think of it, I most certainly don't own enough junk to warrant this much luggage.	game/prologue.rpy	1404	[what]
prologue2_469a341c		I memorized today's schedule well in advance.	game/prologue.rpy	1413	[what]
prologue2_efa9d960		If I get there early, I'll have five hours to try and finish Dracula.	game/prologue.rpy	1414	[what]
prologue2_a0ba6ca2		She doesn't seem convinced, but I'm in a bit of a hurry.	game/prologue.rpy	1424	[what]
prologue2_8369d781		She insists on taking three of the five bags, which is more than I actually need.	game/prologue.rpy	1434	[what]
prologue2_0cee3207		But she seems happy to have someone to talk to.	game/prologue.rpy	1435	[what]
prologue2_cdea831b		I notice other students helping with orientation are in red volunteer shirts, but she doesn't have one.	game/prologue.rpy	1436	[what]
prologue2_a6cfd7fa		Is she actually helping with orientation?	game/prologue.rpy	1437	[what]
nk_intro_bc3fb440		I get to the room and set down my things.	game/prologue.rpy	1455	[what]
nk_intro_ea8762aa		I'm not sure what I can expect from this school, but I do know one thing.	game/prologue.rpy	1456	[what]
nk_intro_ee7022a2		By the end of the year, the student body will be in the palm of my hand.	game/prologue.rpy	1457	[what]
nk_intro_b94b8fd3		I mean, why else does someone become student body president, resume material? I think not.	game/prologue.rpy	1458	[what]
nk_intro_0034a10e		I may not be able to clear my name through the DVP, but if I make enough of an impression, they can't just lock me away and pretend nothing happened.	game/prologue.rpy	1459	[what]
nk_intro_c3e262b8		After I've gotten settled, I'll take a look around the school.	game/prologue.rpy	1460	[what]
prologue_meet_students_46065f1b		Well, I found all my friends, should I go start the meeting?	game/prologue.rpy	1479	[what]
prologue_meet_students_9c49b443		Okay, where should I start looking?	game/prologue.rpy	1490	[what]
prologue_meet_students_82cd9f3a		Where should I look now?	game/prologue.rpy	1492	[what]
prologue_lecture_hall_ffd19864		Hiro isn't here anymore.	game/prologue.rpy	1640	[what]
prologue_field_6bbcbc03		There seems to be nobody here anymore.	game/prologue.rpy	1656	[what]
prologue_hallway_6bbcbc03		There seems to be nobody here anymore.	game/prologue.rpy	1672	[what]
prologue_courtyard_383c8c38		Uitto isn't here anymore.	game/prologue.rpy	1689	[what]
prologue_stage_6bbcbc03		There seems to be nobody here anymore.	game/prologue.rpy	1705	[what]
prologue_av_6bbcbc03		There seems to be nobody here anymore.	game/prologue.rpy	1721	[what]
prologue_nurse_office_6bbcbc03		There seems to be nobody here anymore.	game/prologue.rpy	1737	[what]
prologue_pond_6bbcbc03		There seems to be nobody here anymore.	game/prologue.rpy	1753	[what]
prologue_roof_6bbcbc03		There seems to be nobody here anymore.	game/prologue.rpy	1769	[what]
prologue_library_6bbcbc03		There seems to be nobody here anymore.	game/prologue.rpy	1785	[what]
prologue_sewing_room_6bbcbc03		There seems to be nobody here anymore.	game/prologue.rpy	1801	[what]
prologue_gym_6bbcbc03		There seems to be nobody here anymore.	game/prologue.rpy	1817	[what]
prologue_cafe_6bbcbc03		There seems to be nobody here anymore.	game/prologue.rpy	1833	[what]
prologue_lab_6bbcbc03		There seems to be nobody here anymore.	game/prologue.rpy	1849	[what]
prologue_classroom_6bbcbc03		There seems to be nobody here anymore.	game/prologue.rpy	1865	[what]
prologue_student_council_room_6bbcbc03		There seems to be nobody here anymore.	game/prologue.rpy	1881	[what]
prologue_forbidden_door_6bbcbc03		There seems to be nobody here anymore.	game/prologue.rpy	1897	[what]
prologue_ampitheater_a2675b89		Jona isn't here anymore.	game/prologue.rpy	1914	[what]
prologue_hiro_1ffbc5af		I arrive at the room where the student council meets.	game/prologue.rpy	1922	[what]
prologue_hiro_5d7fe752		Everything looks too new, too clean, like no one has set foot in here since the school opened.	game/prologue.rpy	1923	[what]
prologue_hiro_ed08ed31		I stand for a while, admiring the leather office chair at the end of the table possibly meant for the student council president.	game/prologue.rpy	1924	[what]
prologue_hiro_cfe025d2		I would give anything to be in charge and shape the future of this school.	game/prologue.rpy	1925	[what]
prologue_hiro_845071fe		It may take a while, but I'm sure I can get there.	game/prologue.rpy	1926	[what]
prologue_hiro_87cdc792		I turn and see one of the last people I expected to see. My former teammate and rival, Hiro Morine.	game/prologue.rpy	1932	[what]
prologue_hiro_5ed1dd92		I mean, I say rival, but it was purely for Odori's attention.	game/prologue.rpy	1933	[what]
prologue_hiro_d5170bfb		He cheated off all my tests while leaving me in the dust when it came to sports or fighting.	game/prologue.rpy	1934	[what]
prologue_hiro_887af609		Any way you slice it, it was never a fair competition. One of us would always have an advantage over the other.	game/prologue.rpy	1935	[what]
prologue_hiro_1d0d8332		But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't bitter that everyone liked hanging out with him at recess.	game/prologue.rpy	1936	[what]
prologue_hiro_93a9efe8		I'm getting off track.	game/prologue.rpy	1937	[what]
prologue_hiro_e95e77f6		I trail off. There's no way of knowing how much he knows about the deal that was cut with the DVP.	game/prologue.rpy	1941	[what]
prologue_hiro_6fa8aa42		If I say the wrong thing, I could jeopardize his chance at getting pardoned.	game/prologue.rpy	1942	[what]
prologue_hiro_e4b0cd47		He's as determined as ever.	game/prologue.rpy	1969	[what]
prologue_hiro_9e51c007		He stares at me blankly.	game/prologue.rpy	1976	[what]
prologue_hiro_cfcb95f3		That is odd, I'll have to look into that.	game/prologue.rpy	2004	[what]
prologue_hiro_18275d5d		Well that's good. He has a bad habit of lashing out if people get too close too suddenly.	game/prologue.rpy	2043	[what]
prologue_hiro_25cb55ca		That thing about the kid punching the wall kinda concerns me though.	game/prologue.rpy	2044	[what]
prologue_hiro_4ae6e3a6		I must look like I'm about to clock him or something because he starts laughing like a mad man.	game/prologue.rpy	2111	[what]
prologue_hiro_43b38bc8		Odori was the one who brought us all together in the first place.	game/prologue.rpy	2136	[what]
prologue_hiro_841f2fa5		The Liberation Front was her dream, and a part of it died with her.	game/prologue.rpy	2137	[what]
prologue_hiro_09d8a12e		I've spent way too long listening to what other people tell me to do.	game/prologue.rpy	2171	[what]
prologue_hiro_4cdddf78		Once I've finished scoping out the school, I'm breaking out the strategy board.	game/prologue.rpy	2172	[what]
prologue_hiro_457609ba		I should get going. There's still more of the school to see.	game/prologue.rpy	2173	[what]
prologue_mariko_4036a459		A few years ago, I probably wouldn't be anywhere near here. Maybe this year will be different.	game/prologue.rpy	2179	[what]
prologue_mariko_37f663ad		In the corner of my eye, I see a girl in black spandex bound over, a pile of papers in her hands.	game/prologue.rpy	2180	[what]
prologue_mariko_65024317		Her chipper demeanor falters once she looks up. It's as if the life has been sucked right out of her.	game/prologue.rpy	2188	[what]
prologue_mariko_861ab525		She shifts, using her papers as a physical barrier between us.	game/prologue.rpy	2189	[what]
prologue_mariko_1819be0e		Floundering for a proper social response, she goes with the first thing I imagine comes to mind.	game/prologue.rpy	2190	[what]
prologue_mariko_6a88b550		Her tone is tight, her smile forced. I'd judge, but I have always been awkward around people myself.	game/prologue.rpy	2194	[what]
prologue_mariko_144623b0		Being an ex-villain just makes things that more difficult, I guess.	game/prologue.rpy	2195	[what]
prologue_mariko_65cd72d7		Her defensiveness eases, but it's clear she's still wary.	game/prologue.rpy	2205	[what]
prologue_mariko_f3a6229c		Not that I blame her, she was once a member of my army. One of the more resistant.	game/prologue.rpy	2206	[what]
prologue_mariko_d20f56d9		I don't know if it was her Proficiency or pure determination, but she had fought the brainwashing harder than anyone else.	game/prologue.rpy	2207	[what]
prologue_mariko_7cfba28e		With an ability like being unable to feel pain, it can be tricky figuring out if she should be a Vigor or Intelligence major.	game/prologue.rpy	2208	[what]
prologue_mariko_cfe4fe36		Well I say my army, but Hiro was the one that gathered and directed everyone.	game/prologue.rpy	2209	[what]
prologue_mariko_a41ed93e		I kinda just watched from rooftops and corrected his orders through radio and the like.	game/prologue.rpy	2210	[what]
prologue_mariko_486844bc		If it had actually been my army, things might have gone smoother.	game/prologue.rpy	2211	[what]
prologue_mariko_c67e40c6		She smiles that polite, forced smile one receives out of pity.	game/prologue.rpy	2221	[what]
prologue_mariko_6328ffa5		To be fair, I wasn't exactly the most outgoing kid in the world and I didn't have the best lasting impression on her.	game/prologue.rpy	2222	[what]
prologue_mariko_b8b9a588		That was the roughest shift in a conversation I've heard since my dad.	game/prologue.rpy	2226	[what]
prologue_mariko_b8592d05		A lot of examples come to mind, but I have to focus on the task at hand.	game/prologue.rpy	2227	[what]
prologue_mariko_4c11cee1		Her face hardens.	game/prologue.rpy	2231	[what]
prologue_mariko_0fb2d05f		She takes a deep breath.	game/prologue.rpy	2235	[what]
prologue_mariko_de65c4d1		Her eyes drift to me, then shaking her head.	game/prologue.rpy	2239	[what]
prologue_mariko_553d15e9		She hurries off. Not that I blame her.	game/prologue.rpy	2243	[what]
prologue_mariko_657ce228		She shakes her head, regret evident on her face.	game/prologue.rpy	2251	[what]
prologue_mariko_b957ab0b		When Hiro had gone around recruiting our first members, Mariko declined.	game/prologue.rpy	2252	[what]
prologue_mariko_b0499716		She was the only cheerleader who declined, and her position as the captain didn't matter to anyone when Guwon was already in chaos.	game/prologue.rpy	2253	[what]
prologue_mariko_91b49ac5		She laughs bitterly.	game/prologue.rpy	2265	[what]
prologue_mariko_8f759570		She may be done fighting, but I'm not. I'll keep pushing forward until there's nothing of me left.	game/prologue.rpy	2271	[what]
prologue_mariko_6f999d3a		Though I'm surprised she's here considering what I was sent here to do. I'm sure she had hoped to never see me again.	game/prologue.rpy	2275	[what]
prologue_mariko_b657a017		Does that mean there are other kids from the Liberation Front at this school?	game/prologue.rpy	2276	[what]
prologue_mariko_e896fdfe		Between Odori's hero club and my dad's endless examinations, I didn't have a lot of time for anything.	game/prologue.rpy	2284	[what]
prologue_mariko_7f2b1778		I was constantly underslept to the point that anything involving standing seemed taxing.	game/prologue.rpy	2285	[what]
prologue_mariko_e3d64714		She breathes a huge sigh of relief. Still a little anxious, but no longer petrified.	game/prologue.rpy	2291	[what]
prologue_mariko_78471d1c		She immediately turns around and leaves. I doubt she'll be coming my way anytime soon.	game/prologue.rpy	2295	[what]
prologue_mariko_8e627c53		She clearly recognizes me from the Guwon Riots.	game/prologue.rpy	2301	[what]
prologue_mariko_f8ce8d1e		Mariko had been a member of my army, and not of her own volition. She was one of the last who fell under our control.	game/prologue.rpy	2302	[what]
prologue_mariko_7f1338ba		I doubt she'd want anything to do with me, and I'm not going to pretend I like the idea of seeing her anyway.	game/prologue.rpy	2303	[what]
prologue_mariko_875ddf70		What were they thinking, sending both of us to the same school?	game/prologue.rpy	2304	[what]
prologue_mariko_04e96872		The whole point of witness protection is to maintain a normal life, and she is an obvious threat.	game/prologue.rpy	2305	[what]
prologue_mariko_d450519a		She sputters in outrage. There are a million things I'm sure she wants to say to me, but it wouldn't change anything.	game/prologue.rpy	2312	[what]
prologue_mariko_6218c148		I don't have time for her to collect her thoughts.	game/prologue.rpy	2313	[what]
prologue_mariko_2427d938		As I begin to walk away, she shouts after me.	game/prologue.rpy	2314	[what]
prologue_mariko_746ae548		She gestures to her earrings like I'm going to look at every girls' ears before talking to them.	game/prologue.rpy	2319	[what]
prologue_mariko_3515e3d1		It's almost admirable how fervently she defends this so-called 'squad' when she hasn't even gotten permission to lead one in the first place.	game/prologue.rpy	2329	[what]
prologue_mariko_af13fda9		Old habits die hard, I suppose.	game/prologue.rpy	2330	[what]
prologue_mariko_a4c5247e		Though she wasn't a terribly good leader. All bark and no bite.	game/prologue.rpy	2331	[what]
prologue_mariko_b05c17ca		I should look around some more.	game/prologue.rpy	2335	[what]
prologue_yoku_7c4d6890		The grounds of this school are a lot larger than I anticipated.	game/prologue.rpy	2341	[what]
prologue_yoku_2d20c528		I'll need at least an hour before classes start in order to figure out where I'm going.	game/prologue.rpy	2342	[what]
prologue_yoku_7c98c6f8		I wander into a back hallway on the second floor.	game/prologue.rpy	2343	[what]
prologue_yoku_3ca38528		I assume all of the art classes will be taking place here based on the glass display cases.	game/prologue.rpy	2344	[what]
prologue_yoku_92feadc7		With all the classrooms locked, there isn't much to see right now.	game/prologue.rpy	2345	[what]
prologue_yoku_5cda682d		Though I don't seem to be the only person wandering around campus right now.	game/prologue.rpy	2346	[what]
prologue_yoku_02fce5c2		He has a beaten-up piece of paper in his hand and seems lost.	game/prologue.rpy	2347	[what]
prologue_yoku_23c8d3be		When he looks up at me, I feel a chill run down my spine.	game/prologue.rpy	2348	[what]
prologue_yoku_f8fbe6c1		A few things come to mind, most tracing back to the last two years.	game/prologue.rpy	2356	[what]
prologue_yoku_54ecb000		In the course of a year, Odori and I had raised an army of three hundred with the education collars.	game/prologue.rpy	2357	[what]
prologue_yoku_07151319		They essentially hijacked a person's body through their central nervous system.	game/prologue.rpy	2358	[what]
prologue_yoku_6becb10c		With it, we could train our troops in a matter of hours.	game/prologue.rpy	2359	[what]
prologue_yoku_227ca4d2		However, not everyone was as keen on this idea. Most of the soldiers had been students at our school.	game/prologue.rpy	2360	[what]
prologue_yoku_48748d4a		Granted, I never came in contact with a lot of recruits, so the question is, how does this kid know me?	game/prologue.rpy	2361	[what]
prologue_yoku_c9eb67b5		I recognize him from the posters at Estella back when we were kids, a real wiz-kid with a piano.	game/prologue.rpy	2362	[what]
prologue_yoku_3130c639		We never crossed paths since I spent most of my time studying in my room.	game/prologue.rpy	2363	[what]
prologue_yoku_dd8ae934		My room, of course, being an anti-social hotspot.	game/prologue.rpy	2364	[what]
prologue_yoku_0fb5e9e0		Okay, so I'm a little self-conscious about my so-called 'powers'.	game/prologue.rpy	2391	[what]
prologue_yoku_26091e11		But it isn't like I think being able to remember everything is pointless or lame, it's served me fairly well.	game/prologue.rpy	2392	[what]
prologue_yoku_929f22b9		The thing is, my Proficiency is artificial.	game/prologue.rpy	2393	[what]
prologue_yoku_1588e50d		Unlike child prodigies like Yoku, my father had to spend every waking moment forcing my brain to process memories the way it does.	game/prologue.rpy	2394	[what]
prologue_yoku_bbbf42a0		He freezes.	game/prologue.rpy	2411	[what]
prologue_yoku_8ae8f020		His face pinches up, as if his lower lip is trying to retreat up his nose.	game/prologue.rpy	2417	[what]
prologue_yoku_bf93b679		I shake my head as he speaks.	game/prologue.rpy	2421	[what]
prologue_yoku_8dcc8a80		I'll be fine once I map out the entire school, but my cheapo emergency phone is almost dead and Maimai will flip if she calls and I don't answer.	game/prologue.rpy	2431	[what]
prologue_yoku_9be6d018		That's never a good phrase to hear.	game/prologue.rpy	2443	[what]
prologue_yoku_e80f5281		He sighs.	game/prologue.rpy	2447	[what]
prologue_yoku_dfdb677c		Granted, I shouldn't be proud of the things I did, but it's okay to feel a little insulted by this, right?	game/prologue.rpy	2464	[what]
prologue_yoku_5c50036f		I'm just mad he's calling me stupid.	game/prologue.rpy	2465	[what]
prologue_yoku_3f8adbe3		I've never seen someone so disgusted at the mention of other human beings. And I thought I was antisocial, dang.	game/prologue.rpy	2478	[what]
prologue_yoku_6b6f46da		He just walks off, shaking his head.	game/prologue.rpy	2503	[what]
prologue_yoku_1dc120c4		I don't think I said anything that weird. People ask me about my hair all the time... I think.	game/prologue.rpy	2504	[what]
prologue_yoku_6c5e1533		It's been a while since I've talked to people on relatively friendly terms. Maybe crazy is the new normal.	game/prologue.rpy	2505	[what]
prologue_yoku_b459e33c		If that's true, my friends might actually have a shot at freedom.	game/prologue.rpy	2506	[what]
prologue_yoku_716e8d18		He didn't seem to have that much to say to me. That's fine, I'm not here to make new friends.	game/prologue.rpy	2510	[what]
prologue_yoku_64a124ee		The sooner I can find a way out of here, the better.	game/prologue.rpy	2511	[what]
prologue_uitto_c89e3458		I decide to check the back of the school.	game/prologue.rpy	2519	[what]
prologue_uitto_240ac3d2		Sun pours down into the center of the courtyard. It should feel warm and inviting.	game/prologue.rpy	2520	[what]
prologue_uitto_d77aec88		Devoid of any activity, it's unsettling. I feel like I shouldn't be here.	game/prologue.rpy	2521	[what]
prologue_uitto_f90709af		I'm not alone, though. In the corner of my eye, I see a girl with a brilliant stream of scarlet hair.	game/prologue.rpy	2522	[what]
prologue_uitto_5e4ceacb		She's looking out towards the sky with a forlorn grimace.	game/prologue.rpy	2523	[what]
prologue_uitto_e6be6338		Her voice is definitely familiar. She turns on me with a wicked grin.	game/prologue.rpy	2531	[what]
prologue_uitto_9d8a2c49		Oh no.	game/prologue.rpy	2538	[what]
prologue_uitto_fdad6267		I'll be honest, out of everyone, I'm not surprised she made it.	game/prologue.rpy	2579	[what]
prologue_uitto_192e1760		When we were kids, they used to call her 'The Closer'.	game/prologue.rpy	2580	[what]
prologue_uitto_8580e6ea		She could talk her way into and out of any situation and was a headliner in the pageant circuit.	game/prologue.rpy	2581	[what]
prologue_uitto_3fc7516d		It's not surprising she's taller than me either, just disappointing.	game/prologue.rpy	2582	[what]
prologue_uitto_2fba7beb		I had hoped to be taller than at least one of my friends.	game/prologue.rpy	2583	[what]
prologue_uitto_f3ae903a		There are still other places to look at. I should go.	game/prologue.rpy	2771	[what]
prologue_kitsune_c733ed00		I'm honestly surprised they bothered to build this when there was a functional amphitheater on the grounds.	game/prologue.rpy	2779	[what]
prologue_kitsune_2f634379		There's only enough seating for twenty to thirty people, but the walls are decorated to create the illusion of a vast balcony.	game/prologue.rpy	2780	[what]
prologue_kitsune_d53ac50a		At least they didn't fill the fake seats with human silhouettes.	game/prologue.rpy	2781	[what]
prologue_kitsune_54a831d1		The stage itself is polished and well lit. It has more than enough space for rehearsals.	game/prologue.rpy	2782	[what]
prologue_kitsune_eb0fa678		No harm was done, but it would be fun to mess with her a bit.	game/prologue.rpy	2808	[what]
prologue_kitsune_f6bd5da9		I never forget a face, but she's wearing so much makeup it's hard to tell where her face starts and the contouring ends.	game/prologue.rpy	2816	[what]
prologue_kitsune_9122b05b		Good god did I hit the nail on the head with this one.	game/prologue.rpy	2822	[what]
prologue_kitsune_09401871		I'd bet money she rehearsed that speech in the mirror while brushing her hair.	game/prologue.rpy	2823	[what]
prologue_kitsune_ecdb8cc1		This girl is full of nothing answers, isn't she?	game/prologue.rpy	2829	[what]
prologue_kitsune_23f4ba3f		What the ever-loving fuck did I do to her?	game/prologue.rpy	2846	[what]
prologue_kitsune_a7090407		She seems to have calmed down now, but what was that? Does she want to fight me or not?	game/prologue.rpy	2853	[what]
prologue_kitsune_fb5b1f30		I only know Uitto by her stage name; maybe this girl picked out her own?	game/prologue.rpy	2859	[what]
prologue_kitsune_c6ea3669		Shoot, I didn't mean to upset her. Gotta backtrack.	game/prologue.rpy	2880	[what]
prologue_kitsune_16ea61b3		Says the person who was fishing for compliments five minutes ago.	game/prologue.rpy	2891	[what]
prologue_kitsune_4f3dff52		At least she's honest. Seems like a lot of work for little reward.	game/prologue.rpy	2921	[what]
prologue_kitsune_59faa39f		There's no guarantee she'll ever get any fans.	game/prologue.rpy	2922	[what]
prologue_kitsune_b8366615		She blows me a kiss and runs off before I can finish objecting.	game/prologue.rpy	2960	[what]
prologue_kazz_6bc2cb1b		I stumble across a dingy room tucked in the back of the second floor.	game/prologue.rpy	2966	[what]
prologue_kazz_7863c236		The furniture here is considerably older than the classrooms and in worse condition.	game/prologue.rpy	2967	[what]
prologue_kazz_f3d698db		If it wasn't for a small, glass-paneled recording booth, I would have assumed this room was for storage.	game/prologue.rpy	2968	[what]
prologue_kazz_722efb59		Through the windows, I can see purple egg crate walls lined with foam.	game/prologue.rpy	2969	[what]
prologue_kazz_647b7363		A mic dangles from the booth's ceiling, hooked up to three different computers.	game/prologue.rpy	2970	[what]
prologue_kazz_333404b0		I try to go inside, but the door is locked.	game/prologue.rpy	2971	[what]
prologue_kazz_2257767c		It very much does matter if he is who I think he is.	game/prologue.rpy	3000	[what]
prologue_kazz_5a1b2f0e		Professor Kataki worked as an administrator at Estella alongside my father.	game/prologue.rpy	3001	[what]
prologue_kazz_cc8e3cea		His research in neuroscience perpetuated the illusion that Estella Prep was helping people.	game/prologue.rpy	3002	[what]
prologue_kazz_3357c0b1		If this kid's his son, he could be one of the students that made competing for top marks a living hell.	game/prologue.rpy	3003	[what]
prologue_kazz_2f18a25e		Especially since he was proficient in math.	game/prologue.rpy	3004	[what]
prologue_kazz_f6c996b5		I had gotten into a fight with Hiro on my first day and I flipped a desk over in the process.	game/prologue.rpy	3015	[what]
prologue_kazz_83070ad3		It's a wonder we ever became friends.	game/prologue.rpy	3016	[what]
prologue_kazz_c55fd012		Granted, I wasn't terribly close with anyone in my old class.	game/prologue.rpy	3055	[what]
prologue_kazz_572d7956		It was more the embarrassment of being removed I hoped to avoid.	game/prologue.rpy	3056	[what]
prologue_kazz_dd9dcf57		I can't argue with that.	game/prologue.rpy	3073	[what]
prologue_kazz_bc785988		Why couldn't I reap the benefits of being a teacher's kid?	game/prologue.rpy	3085	[what]
prologue_kazz_07289714		No, no way. There can't be that many people from Estella here.	game/prologue.rpy	3111	[what]
prologue_kazz_73010919		These people didn't just seek us out based on where we came from, did they?	game/prologue.rpy	3112	[what]
prologue_kazz_f40c7b22		We're being collected here on purpose.	game/prologue.rpy	3118	[what]
prologue_kazz_36c45bb1		Why do they want us all in one place? What are they planning?	game/prologue.rpy	3119	[what]
prologue_kazz_8d516f68		There has to be a reason.	game/prologue.rpy	3120	[what]
prologue_kazz_f352f30b		I gotta move. I have to breathe.	game/prologue.rpy	3124	[what]
prologue_kazz_5aa15db5		Focus on walking. Kazz looks scared.	game/prologue.rpy	3125	[what]
prologue_kazz_3518dc58		I need to calm down.	game/prologue.rpy	3126	[what]
prologue_kazz_891c07f4		Shit!	game/prologue.rpy	3127	[what]
prologue_kazz_e13e4bbd		He still looks worried, but I'm already out the door.	game/prologue.rpy	3137	[what]
prologue_oshin_a2813c05		The nurse's office is small, to say the least.	game/prologue.rpy	3143	[what]
prologue_oshin_63968157		It can barely fit two pennies in between all the filing cabinets and office supplies.	game/prologue.rpy	3144	[what]
prologue_oshin_7bccf4e4		There's no needles out, which is good, sharps freak me out.	game/prologue.rpy	3145	[what]
prologue_oshin_0696a032		In fact, even the smell of latex and hand sanitiser can sometimes set me off, but this place reeks of something else.	game/prologue.rpy	3146	[what]
prologue_oshin_2aa06b9e		Like bitter, musty salad that rotted in a pool of Ax body spray.	game/prologue.rpy	3147	[what]
prologue_oshin_9f71b3c3		Do people still even use that stuff?	game/prologue.rpy	3148	[what]
prologue_oshin_8f7dd41d		That doesn't sound like a nurse.	game/prologue.rpy	3152	[what]
prologue_oshin_52415ce1		I see rustling behind the curtain of the back cot. It couldn't be...	game/prologue.rpy	3153	[what]
prologue_oshin_ad578ef4		The curtain flies back and I have to say, I am severely disappointed.	game/prologue.rpy	3157	[what]
prologue_oshin_67c6ce49		If you're going to break the rules, at least look cool doing it.	game/prologue.rpy	3161	[what]
prologue_oshin_a930d263		Or shower first.	game/prologue.rpy	3162	[what]
prologue_oshin_ede06c4a		He used to take so much pride in 'knowing' more than me in biology and anatomy; I wonder if he still has that competitive streak.	game/prologue.rpy	3163	[what]
prologue_oshin_ddd95ef8		That's something I can sympathize with as a fellow Intelligence major. When they ran out of things to teach you, they'd give you busy work.	game/prologue.rpy	3181	[what]
prologue_oshin_61928b45		So this is the limit to having a Medicine Proficiency.	game/prologue.rpy	3182	[what]
prologue_oshin_a99b68f3		When he'd go off in class about internal organs, I thought he'd grow up to be a serial killer, not a stoner.	game/prologue.rpy	3183	[what]
prologue_oshin_62cf937a		Still, he isn't the first person I'd choose to patch my wounds.	game/prologue.rpy	3184	[what]
prologue_oshin_422f080d		He blows out a cloud of smoke.	game/prologue.rpy	3234	[what]
prologue_oshin_92a2992a		Ironically, I know quite a bit about medicine.	game/prologue.rpy	3248	[what]
prologue_oshin_b7195a96		My father was particularly enchanted with using me as a test subject for all his patent drugs.	game/prologue.rpy	3249	[what]
prologue_oshin_06cf21c7		Most of what he made were stimulants or Proficiency enhancers, neither of which would be applicable here.	game/prologue.rpy	3250	[what]
prologue_oshin_f3b8ca2c		However...	game/prologue.rpy	3251	[what]
prologue_oshin_eaf200a0		He holds aloft a small lighter with a skeleton on it.	game/prologue.rpy	3267	[what]
prologue_oshin_73b4b0c7		I don't think he's going to stop laughing any time soon.	game/prologue.rpy	3282	[what]
prologue_oshin_427bea3e		Unfortunately, I've been injured by less threatening objects.	game/prologue.rpy	3290	[what]
prologue_oshin_b1494723		What he said in jest could very well happen if I run into the wrong cheerleader.	game/prologue.rpy	3291	[what]
prologue_ichita_2d103919		When I think of high school, I imagine a gray cement building with crowded halls and an oppressive air about the place.	game/prologue.rpy	3299	[what]
prologue_ichita_292a5af5		The kind that's earned from decades of kids grinding gum into the pavement.	game/prologue.rpy	3300	[what]
prologue_ichita_070c7d53		Maybe it's because this place hasn't been a school for very long, but the entryway doesn't feel haunted.	game/prologue.rpy	3301	[what]
prologue_ichita_7378a1d2		It makes it all the more jarring to see someone declaring how happy he is to be here.	game/prologue.rpy	3302	[what]
prologue_ichita_c8028116		Waaay too happy for the first day of school.	game/prologue.rpy	3308	[what]
prologue_ichita_85c1de73		I'm spotted and held socially hostage before I can escape the predatory grip of an excited, one-legged extrovert.	game/prologue.rpy	3309	[what]
prologue_ichita_c75c56df		He's almost shaking me as he speaks. Or maybe he's struggling to stand.	game/prologue.rpy	3320	[what]
prologue_ichita_43626ef1		I'm not entirely sure which, I just wish he'd stop touching me.	game/prologue.rpy	3321	[what]
prologue_ichita_d53cf47c		Just as I'm contemplating peeling his hands off my jacket, he lets me go and laughs.	game/prologue.rpy	3325	[what]
prologue_ichita_22bee46e		I have.	game/prologue.rpy	3329	[what]
prologue_ichita_68e3765d		A competitive martial artist that chased after championship titles and treated his opponents like rag dolls.	game/prologue.rpy	3330	[what]
prologue_ichita_82444f12		Hiro was the only one who could withstand his brutal strength Proficiency in a match.	game/prologue.rpy	3331	[what]
prologue_ichita_3bab9573		Wasn't he the one that always came in second place? If anyone was a sore loser, it was him.	game/prologue.rpy	3338	[what]
prologue_ichita_91d50495		His whole demeanor changes. I regret bringing him up.	game/prologue.rpy	3367	[what]
prologue_ichita_b301af77		I know better than anyone that Hiro had a tendency to exaggerate.	game/prologue.rpy	3372	[what]
prologue_ichita_93a7f5ef		I still believe this guy was willing to jump him in the parking lot after he lost a match.	game/prologue.rpy	3373	[what]
prologue_ichita_1322c80b		Neither of us are laughing.	game/prologue.rpy	3377	[what]
prologue_ichita_dfa205bd		He seems happy with whatever decision he's made about me, but his smile doesn't put me at ease.	game/prologue.rpy	3383	[what]
prologue_ichita_27317252		I feel like he's treating me like a little kid.	game/prologue.rpy	3391	[what]
prologue_ichita_c52da823		This conceited-	game/prologue.rpy	3397	[what]
prologue_ichita_d1b6ee84		Hunh? Wait, that wasn't even remotely sarcastic.	game/prologue.rpy	3401	[what]
prologue_ichita_379e5add		He's looking at me with so much hope...	game/prologue.rpy	3402	[what]
prologue_ichita_8ac5afc8		At least his expectations are low.	game/prologue.rpy	3408	[what]
prologue_ichita_649d7580		There are still some other places I haven't checked yet. I'll keep looking.	game/prologue.rpy	3439	[what]
prologue_taiga_86074845		I make my way to the uppermost floor of the main building.	game/prologue.rpy	3445	[what]
prologue_taiga_09f2ad48		The entryway to the stairs is blocked off with piles of wood and neglected supplies strewn about.	game/prologue.rpy	3446	[what]
prologue_taiga_057a25d1		I wonder if they put a hold on renovations; I don't see any tools laying around.	game/prologue.rpy	3447	[what]
prologue_taiga_1c2bbb28		I slip through a gap in the tarp and get blinded by sunlight.	game/prologue.rpy	3448	[what]
prologue_taiga_127ddfd9		Anything that couldn't be salvaged has been left to rot in the elements.	game/prologue.rpy	3449	[what]
prologue_taiga_b598c4b4		However, the palettes and busted shelves are too carefully arranged to say they were abandoned.	game/prologue.rpy	3450	[what]
prologue_taiga_0d807a64		Looking out over the expansive grounds is a kid in loose-fitting festival robes.	game/prologue.rpy	3451	[what]
prologue_taiga_70348a43		He gives me a passing glance and resumes glaring at the horizon.	game/prologue.rpy	3452	[what]
prologue_taiga_07ad5223		There's an obligatory fence, but nothing to stop students from sitting on the edge.	game/prologue.rpy	3453	[what]
prologue_taiga_88924868		He shudders.	game/prologue.rpy	3462	[what]
prologue_taiga_fa1631be		His attention is more focused on something in his lap.	game/prologue.rpy	3474	[what]
prologue_taiga_d67cb8d3		A small furry face pops out from under his sleeve.	game/prologue.rpy	3480	[what]
prologue_taiga_f998bf8b		It's a gray lop-eared bunny with a blue-collar.	game/prologue.rpy	3486	[what]
prologue_taiga_46004368		His coat is broken up with a handful of scars, but overall, he seems healthy.	game/prologue.rpy	3487	[what]
prologue_taiga_bc920deb		I've never seen a rabbit so calm before.	game/prologue.rpy	3488	[what]
prologue_taiga_426193e0		Perhaps I was too eager with the way I asked.	game/prologue.rpy	3496	[what]
prologue_taiga_c7c54c6b		He stares, shell shocked, before nodding.	game/prologue.rpy	3497	[what]
prologue_taiga_74110ac1		I sit down next to him and hold out my hand to the rabbit.	game/prologue.rpy	3501	[what]
prologue_taiga_e6a60248		It cautiously sniffs my hand before sinking its teeth into the leather of my glove.	game/prologue.rpy	3502	[what]
prologue_taiga_5e5d1198		I try to pull back, but the rabbit won't let go, all while his owner laughs.	game/prologue.rpy	3506	[what]
prologue_taiga_cd9a8566		Freedom!	game/prologue.rpy	3510	[what]
prologue_taiga_da875b29		I make sure there are no holes before looking back at the offended rabbit.	game/prologue.rpy	3511	[what]
prologue_taiga_cc49b582		I've never seen an animal look so personally attacked before.	game/prologue.rpy	3516	[what]
prologue_taiga_a29aca79		He keeps licking his owner's hand as I pocket my glove.	game/prologue.rpy	3517	[what]
prologue_taiga_6b95526e		I follow his instructions and get immediately rewarded. The bunny practically melts in his lap.	game/prologue.rpy	3521	[what]
prologue_taiga_e3b4f00d		His cheeks light up bright red and his eyes narrow.	game/prologue.rpy	3531	[what]
prologue_taiga_9cee1a6f		Does that mean there are more rabbits hiding in the school?	game/prologue.rpy	3536	[what]
prologue_taiga_30447c29		Rich is an overstatement, but before I can form a response, there's a rabbit on my foot.	game/prologue.rpy	3543	[what]
prologue_taiga_b8fb66d3		The little gray monster scampers into his sleeve to hide.	game/prologue.rpy	3549	[what]
prologue_taiga_6cdc62be		He stares off into space, retracing the conversation in his mind.	game/prologue.rpy	3560	[what]
prologue_taiga_907f3b92		There's nothing keeping that animal in his lap other than sheer willpower.	game/prologue.rpy	3566	[what]
prologue_taiga_b80ae5d4		I can't help but be concerned when he doesn't even have a hand on him.	game/prologue.rpy	3580	[what]
prologue_taiga_11c83b7e		The longer the silence goes on, the more puzzled he looks.	game/prologue.rpy	3593	[what]
prologue_taiga_55995621		Did he make up the last name?	game/prologue.rpy	3600	[what]
prologue_taiga_ef2a62b7		It does sound familiar, but I don't remember anyone with that name going to Estella Academy.	game/prologue.rpy	3601	[what]
prologue_taiga_d9447d2c		I really hope not. It was weird enough getting called that by the principal.	game/prologue.rpy	3610	[what]
prologue_taiga_466caf47		Both of my parents were teachers, so any time I hear 'Mr. Tesuta', I think of my dad.	game/prologue.rpy	3611	[what]
prologue_taiga_11eebede		I couldn't agree more, but this conversation's kind of bumming me out. Not that I blame him, but I should go.	game/prologue.rpy	3617	[what]
prologue_chisei_35c23db6		Out of all the rooms in the whole school, this is the only one that hasn't been remodeled.	game/prologue.rpy	3623	[what]
prologue_chisei_9d285365		The bookshelves are molded into the walls, floor to ceiling.	game/prologue.rpy	3624	[what]
prologue_chisei_a78ff953		A walkway splits the shelves in half, allowing access to the topmost shelves.	game/prologue.rpy	3625	[what]
prologue_chisei_2ecbb97b		To think that the whole building once looked like this.	game/prologue.rpy	3626	[what]
prologue_chisei_14435443		Hidden amongst the shelves is a girl with dark hair.	game/prologue.rpy	3627	[what]
prologue_chisei_70d4cf15		She stands fixed in place in front of one of the shelves, refusing to look at me.	game/prologue.rpy	3633	[what]
prologue_chisei_2e1139dd		At least this part seems organized as opposed to books crammed randomly anywhere they fit.	game/prologue.rpy	3639	[what]
prologue_chisei_68ddbae6		She looks down at the floor.	game/prologue.rpy	3640	[what]
prologue_chisei_e2ae466e		I summon all my willpower not to yelp in surprise.	game/prologue.rpy	3651	[what]
prologue_chisei_f8e6de0e		Despite my best efforts, I can feel my eyes wander back to her torn-up arm.	game/prologue.rpy	3652	[what]
prologue_chisei_8cdabfad		I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure she's missing some muscles in her arm and... is that a robot hand?	game/prologue.rpy	3653	[what]
prologue_chisei_6d2176a6		I've been staring too long, I've got to say something.	game/prologue.rpy	3654	[what]
prologue_chisei_da3b82c3		She talks with barely any emotion at all.	game/prologue.rpy	3675	[what]
prologue_chisei_936bec2c		It's hard to tell if she's trying to make another joke or if she's being sincere.	game/prologue.rpy	3676	[what]
prologue_chisei_06398373		She sighs.	game/prologue.rpy	3682	[what]
prologue_chisei_2f1fbb7f		She hides her gaping smile behind her other hand.	game/prologue.rpy	3692	[what]
prologue_chisei_19d6e4ad		She giggles as I realize with dawning horror she's one of those people who loves puns.	game/prologue.rpy	3696	[what]
prologue_chisei_7724d066		I can practically feel her adding me to a list of victims.	game/prologue.rpy	3706	[what]
prologue_chisei_9a9e750a		It's basic small talk, so why does she look so down?	game/prologue.rpy	3712	[what]
prologue_chisei_174405ca		Having a prosthetic shouldn't affect your major. Maybe she can't write as well with her left hand?	game/prologue.rpy	3727	[what]
prologue_chisei_6b1b73b2		Not exactly the creepy mentalist stuff I was expecting.	game/prologue.rpy	3749	[what]
prologue_chisei_0dd860ed		She shuffles away, carrying with her a heavy black book... I never told her my name.	game/prologue.rpy	3768	[what]
prologue_shoma_5919c352		As I exit the third floor, I see light trickling through the bottom of an unmarked door.	game/prologue.rpy	3776	[what]
prologue_shoma_6764940e		Curiosity gets the better of me and I take a step inside. The air is thick and humid.	game/prologue.rpy	3777	[what]
prologue_shoma_b7f3395a		A small swamp cooler rattles in the back window, struggling to cool the room by a degree.	game/prologue.rpy	3778	[what]
prologue_shoma_64fb34ed		A boy is setting up a retro sewing machine that looks like it's been fetched out of a dump.	game/prologue.rpy	3779	[what]
prologue_shoma_aef67534		He looks up with a smirk, eyeing me up and down.	game/prologue.rpy	3780	[what]
prologue_shoma_96dc3aa8		Eyes... Oh, this is that kid from the Vigor program that Hiro always told me about.	game/prologue.rpy	3791	[what]
prologue_shoma_2fdee95e		All the Vigor majors he'd met before gravitated towards sports, but not him.	game/prologue.rpy	3792	[what]
prologue_shoma_df4df366		The guy's got eyes able zoom in and out like a camera.	game/prologue.rpy	3793	[what]
prologue_shoma_578e2d81		He used to sit in the back of the class, a bit of a loner type.	game/prologue.rpy	3794	[what]
prologue_shoma_92f94b96		...Probably shouldn't have led with that.	game/prologue.rpy	3800	[what]
prologue_shoma_f12b15e2		This place has multiple theaters but no place to make the costumes? That doesn't make sense.	game/prologue.rpy	3812	[what]
prologue_shoma_248ee32a		He doesn't seem the least bit annoyed by that.	game/prologue.rpy	3860	[what]
prologue_shoma_47584b9f		If that had been me, I would have already marched down the hall demanding a room change.	game/prologue.rpy	3861	[what]
prologue_shoma_04d932cf		Well, if it really doesn't bother him, there's nothing I can do.	game/prologue.rpy	3862	[what]
prologue_shoma_eec5c6a3		I can tell he's not trying to be rude, which makes it worse.	game/prologue.rpy	3875	[what]
prologue_shoma_5c6f11ef		So not helping.	game/prologue.rpy	3881	[what]
prologue_shoma_12b4b3fb		It's as if he's peering into a dark void off into the horizon. I'm not sure what he's seeing.	game/prologue.rpy	3905	[what]
prologue_shoma_518ef6da		He shudders a bit and then smiles at me.	game/prologue.rpy	3906	[what]
prologue_shoma_98742724		Even though we were in the same homeroom, we weren't friends exactly.	game/prologue.rpy	3913	[what]
prologue_shoma_e8cb6c47		He's just someone I kind of grew up with. That's not exactly the relationship that gets you free stuff.	game/prologue.rpy	3914	[what]
prologue_shoma_e8c86ac2		With that, he ushers me out of the room. He wanders off with a heavy step.	game/prologue.rpy	3929	[what]
prologue_shoma_f54adc15		I should get going too.	game/prologue.rpy	3930	[what]
prologue_setsuna_c6175200		My footsteps squeak as the smell of floor polish and vinyl hits me in the face.	game/prologue.rpy	3936	[what]
prologue_setsuna_023c2740		It must have been built recently for the place to be so clean.	game/prologue.rpy	3937	[what]
prologue_setsuna_25516435		I had heard there was supposed to be a pool here, but this is clearly a basketball court.	game/prologue.rpy	3938	[what]
prologue_setsuna_26137748		What the- where did that come from?	game/prologue.rpy	3946	[what]
prologue_setsuna_6a550f20		She smiles with such ease. I can't help but feel a little jealous.	game/prologue.rpy	3954	[what]
prologue_setsuna_bd551854		She hums, deep in thought as she messes with the face of her watch.	game/prologue.rpy	3964	[what]
prologue_setsuna_5fb41109		A Charisma major that specializes in being unnoticed, how odd.	game/prologue.rpy	3970	[what]
prologue_setsuna_93cf387c		She laughs at her own joke.	game/prologue.rpy	3976	[what]
prologue_setsuna_a2b43c42		She shudders.	game/prologue.rpy	4001	[what]
prologue_setsuna_20ef1976		She pounds on the gym floor, it sounds... hollow?	game/prologue.rpy	4011	[what]
prologue_setsuna_f30ea78f		That got her to laugh.	game/prologue.rpy	4022	[what]
prologue_setsuna_59e135f5		I wasn't talking about her, so why's she taking it personally?	game/prologue.rpy	4033	[what]
prologue_setsuna_596c4771		There are a million other things I could have said that would be worse.	game/prologue.rpy	4034	[what]
prologue_setsuna_9ef8506b		Ugh, but the way she keeps glaring at me...	game/prologue.rpy	4035	[what]
prologue_setsuna_b7fc4812		I can't tell if she doesn't believe me or just doesn't care. Either way, it pisses me off.	game/prologue.rpy	4047	[what]
prologue_setsuna_a818a155		A high pitched alarm rings from her wristwatch.	game/prologue.rpy	4049	[what]
prologue_setsuna_5d0ca339		She immediately turns to leave.	game/prologue.rpy	4053	[what]
prologue_setsuna_ac1e0654		Does this person crave attention so much she sees rumors as competition or... she couldn't be a copycat, could she?	game/prologue.rpy	4062	[what]
prologue_setsuna_e22f8846		I chase after her, but by the time I get outside, she's nowhere to be found.	game/prologue.rpy	4079	[what]
prologue_kietsu_0d34f4e9		I follow a dirt path that branches off to the right of the school's entrance.	game/prologue.rpy	4085	[what]
prologue_kietsu_085c4742		It wraps around to a brick storage shed. Inside is a café lined with wall to wall bookshelves.	game/prologue.rpy	4086	[what]
prologue_kietsu_2b34f56a		Looks like any furniture that doesn't have a complete set gets stored here.	game/prologue.rpy	4087	[what]
prologue_kietsu_2f965527		A heavenly aroma of breakfast wafts through the air.	game/prologue.rpy	4088	[what]
prologue_kietsu_b00f3138		At one of the tables, a kid in trashed clothes is sitting with his head in his arms, muttering something to himself.	game/prologue.rpy	4089	[what]
prologue_kietsu_6b808c86		I nudge the leg of his chair with my foot and he jumps up with a start.	game/prologue.rpy	4095	[what]
prologue_kietsu_ff06ae9f		There's a whole room of empty chairs. Why would I want to take the one he was sitting in?	game/prologue.rpy	4102	[what]
prologue_kietsu_34b1df06		I can't resist the call of free food. I join him at his table.	game/prologue.rpy	4116	[what]
prologue_kietsu_bbbd0f0c		It seems like the first thing he did when he got here was figure out where to eat.	game/prologue.rpy	4117	[what]
prologue_kietsu_8643f522		A big plate of fried appetizers is set between us.	game/prologue.rpy	4118	[what]
prologue_kietsu_59b85329		Camps designed to stop kids from developing 'unnatural' abilities that could label them as a Vision major.	game/prologue.rpy	4138	[what]
prologue_kietsu_c5b37e79		Some of those places could be downright criminal, and none of them worked. I didn't know they were still around.	game/prologue.rpy	4139	[what]
prologue_kietsu_d5ca7a85		He trails off. With his sunglasses, it's hard to tell if he's looking at me or totally zoning out.	game/prologue.rpy	4159	[what]
prologue_kietsu_63bd3cba		I check behind me, just to be sure, but we're the only people in the lobby.	game/prologue.rpy	4160	[what]
prologue_kietsu_dcd92c3b		I wave at him to get his attention.	game/prologue.rpy	4161	[what]
prologue_kietsu_206d824d		He drums on the table with his knuckles.	game/prologue.rpy	4179	[what]
prologue_kietsu_cb0a1424		He rubs his temples.	game/prologue.rpy	4187	[what]
prologue_kietsu_b6d55800		He's zoning out again, but I can tell he's still somewhat present.	game/prologue.rpy	4242	[what]
prologue_kietsu_76770023		He seems genuinely happy to be here, and the food is good.	game/prologue.rpy	4251	[what]
prologue_kietsu_96114ea2		He laughs.	game/prologue.rpy	4288	[what]
prologue_kietsu_07c5924d		I wonder...	game/prologue.rpy	4334	[what]
prologue_kietsu_e59bf03e		Could it be? Did Vivaldi really meet this guy in person? Why?	game/prologue.rpy	4355	[what]
prologue_kietsu_b7905816		There are only three cheese curds left. I barely had any. Where did they all go?	game/prologue.rpy	4372	[what]
prologue_kietsu_ba44d090		He shoots a couple finger guns at me before walking away...	game/prologue.rpy	4381	[what]
prologue_kietsu_f5fb59f1		The food's all gone. I should keep moving forward.	game/prologue.rpy	4382	[what]
prologue_momoko_a196c54e		As I make my way to the third floor, I hear a huge crash at the end of the hall.	game/prologue.rpy	4388	[what]
prologue_momoko_c4c3097f		The door to the school lab is slightly ajar. I rush in to see a girl with multicolored hair standing in the middle of theroom	game/prologue.rpy	4389	[what]
prologue_momoko_0798f833		Or, at least, standing as well as she can with rollerskates on. Are those even allowed?	game/prologue.rpy	4390	[what]
prologue_momoko_e5a49613		She's trying her best to close one of the cabinets.	game/prologue.rpy	4398	[what]
prologue_momoko_fcec0e4e		A foreboding clunk comes from behind the small wooden door as she backs away.	game/prologue.rpy	4404	[what]
prologue_momoko_fb83e8a2		She starts laughing.	game/prologue.rpy	4410	[what]
prologue_momoko_fcbf21c1		I honestly can't place her face to a name. Her voice is sort of familiar, but...	game/prologue.rpy	4415	[what]
prologue_momoko_12cdf605		She's still laughing at me.	game/prologue.rpy	4416	[what]
prologue_momoko_87365902		I still got nothing, but there's no way I'd forget someone's name.	game/prologue.rpy	4424	[what]
prologue_momoko_c8a426fb		She'd have to have gone to Estella. Was she in my class or the Intel course?	game/prologue.rpy	4425	[what]
prologue_momoko_49b50c87		She used to be the only one in class I was taller than.	game/prologue.rpy	4439	[what]
prologue_momoko_7a6c78ee		She was this mousey wisp of a person who barely had the energy to present a school project.	game/prologue.rpy	4440	[what]
prologue_momoko_a9af7f78		It was like being in class with an asthmatic chihuahua.	game/prologue.rpy	4441	[what]
prologue_momoko_5a9404d4		There's no way I'd have recognized her without any help.	game/prologue.rpy	4442	[what]
prologue_momoko_26a663d8		So this is her idea of what teenage rebellion looks like?	game/prologue.rpy	4473	[what]
prologue_momoko_9cb36458		She gives me a huge, cheesy grin and I can't help smiling too.	game/prologue.rpy	4502	[what]
prologue_momoko_eb9434d6		That's a surprise. She was always so enchanted with fireworks and the like.	game/prologue.rpy	4521	[what]
prologue_momoko_14d6a3c6		I can't imagine her doing anything else.	game/prologue.rpy	4522	[what]
prologue_momoko_0e493581		She shakes her head.	game/prologue.rpy	4532	[what]
prologue_momoko_4e30340c		I'm concerned.	game/prologue.rpy	4559	[what]
prologue_momoko_c99ddcd0		Despite her good intentions, Momoko hasn't had the best track record with hazardous chemicals and staying on task.	game/prologue.rpy	4560	[what]
prologue_momoko_7153baa1		I've turned in more than my fair share of charred paperwork as her lab partner.	game/prologue.rpy	4561	[what]
prologue_momoko_ad1be6f8		And explosions.	game/prologue.rpy	4575	[what]
prologue_momoko_4a952344		Just please, for everyone's safety, fixate on something else.	game/prologue.rpy	4582	[what]
prologue_rei_88ca12c7		The classrooms are filled with wall to wall shelves of books.	game/prologue.rpy	4590	[what]
prologue_rei_9ca401ec		The main floor has been tidied up to make room for the rows of antique tables.	game/prologue.rpy	4591	[what]
prologue_rei_6ed3c90f		At the back of the room is a hologram projection of a blackboard with a welcome message hastily scribbled on it.	game/prologue.rpy	4592	[what]
prologue_rei_981cbae0		This place feels less like a classroom and more like a lecture hall. In the center row, a girl sits quietly crying.	game/prologue.rpy	4593	[what]
prologue_rei_ae5b3534		Her sister's swords? I only know one person whose family heirlooms are weapons.	game/prologue.rpy	4607	[what]
prologue_rei_1627e818		She's always had issues with time.	game/prologue.rpy	4613	[what]
prologue_rei_f607a359		Her poor grades were the only reason she ended up in the 'At Risk' class. It's a shame, really.	game/prologue.rpy	4614	[what]
prologue_rei_4e874d95		Her skills as a dancer and color guard member would have made her somewhat popular if she hadn't been lumped in with us.	game/prologue.rpy	4615	[what]
prologue_rei_769e4599		I respect that she never blamed her classmates for the crummy treatment she received.	game/prologue.rpy	4616	[what]
prologue_rei_a5cd81d3		It would have been really easy to throw us under the bus to save her reputation.	game/prologue.rpy	4617	[what]
prologue_rei_b8f256ab		This girl walks into school with the iron throne strapped to her back and I'm the one on probation?	game/prologue.rpy	4664	[what]
prologue_rei_9c94269b		I honestly didn't think they'd notice I was gone.	game/prologue.rpy	4698	[what]
prologue_rei_42698110		Even though she has no idea what I'm going through, she's still trying to look out for me.	game/prologue.rpy	4706	[what]
prologue_rei_6586657e		So that's what they've been telling everybody else.	game/prologue.rpy	4717	[what]
prologue_rei_bb99121d		It's a shame. As sweet as Rei is, she's too trusting.	game/prologue.rpy	4718	[what]
prologue_rise_5c263846		There's only a few rooms open on the top floor.	game/prologue.rpy	4730	[what]
prologue_rise_bc009ad4		This appears to be a meeting place of some sort, but it's glaringly apparent that everything in the room has never been used.	game/prologue.rpy	4731	[what]
prologue_rise_7dbce773		Every piece of furniture clashes despite the effort to match colors.	game/prologue.rpy	4732	[what]
prologue_rise_0f5d619f		By the large bay window sits a poised girl with a tea set.	game/prologue.rpy	4733	[what]
prologue_rise_d35666f9		Rise Kisaki, her Proficiency is Allure, which I never fully understood.	game/prologue.rpy	4734	[what]
prologue_rise_bd9283a0		According to Uitto, it means she;s a people magnet, like a lot of Charisma majors.	game/prologue.rpy	4735	[what]
prologue_rise_050f71d9		With me being in the “bad kids” class, I never really talked to her.	game/prologue.rpy	4736	[what]
prologue_rise_0e1ea229		Her far off stare reminds me of a china doll. Across from her is an empty cup and chair.	game/prologue.rpy	4737	[what]
prologue_rise_6e98f616		She perks up at the sound of my voice with slow, deliberate blinks.	game/prologue.rpy	4741	[what]
prologue_rise_e7167fe4		There's no reason for me to stay here. I turn and leave.	game/prologue.rpy	4758	[what]
prologue_rise_83eb2780		She says this, yet there's no denying who's in control as she pours me a cup.	game/prologue.rpy	4769	[what]
prologue_rise_ad8d07e7		She pulls out a handful of packages and arranges them neatly on a dish, studying me with care.	game/prologue.rpy	4776	[what]
prologue_rise_3a4a575a		She takes a sip from her own cup. That must be what she's drinking right now	game/prologue.rpy	4787	[what]
prologue_rise_af84d19a		She gently caresses the gold rim of her teacup. It looks pretty old.	game/prologue.rpy	4798	[what]
prologue_rise_01b3a243		She says that, but I feel like she's watching my every move. Too bad there's no food.	game/prologue.rpy	4851	[what]
prologue_rise_5e3d5419		There's a glimmer in her eye as she speaks.	game/prologue.rpy	4870	[what]
prologue_rise_c08999dd		She's acting like she's helping me, but that's clearly an insult towards my friends.	game/prologue.rpy	4880	[what]
prologue_rise_986e26a2		She smiles pleasantly as if nothing's wrong.	game/prologue.rpy	4896	[what]
prologue_rise_8b191fe3		Though I suppose for her, there isn't anything wrong with what she said.	game/prologue.rpy	4897	[what]
prologue_rise_92c76b25		I can't take the silence.	game/prologue.rpy	4898	[what]
prologue_rise_9e1cb70a		I turn and leave.	game/prologue.rpy	4906	[what]
prologue_dyre_d3ee80f0		At the end of the first-floor hallway is a solid metal door with 'Computer Lab' written on it.	game/prologue.rpy	4912	[what]
prologue_dyre_efbb0a28		I can't get it to open, no matter how hard I try.	game/prologue.rpy	4913	[what]
prologue_dyre_43e4b87e		It's not like I need a computer that bad, but I had hoped maybe they had access to the internet.	game/prologue.rpy	4914	[what]
prologue_dyre_6eff08da		Of all the people to run into, why'd it have to be him?	game/prologue.rpy	4920	[what]
prologue_dyre_e3b04646		When we were younger, we hung around each other all the time, until one of his pranks landed us both in deep shit.	game/prologue.rpy	4926	[what]
prologue_dyre_73a9148d		I got expelled to the 'bad kids' class after that; he got a slap on the wrist.	game/prologue.rpy	4927	[what]
prologue_dyre_273559bc		Being the principal's grandson had its perks for him.	game/prologue.rpy	4928	[what]
prologue_dyre_acf37f8a		We stopped talking after that.	game/prologue.rpy	4929	[what]
prologue_dyre_6572e503		He smiles at me like the cat that got the canary.	game/prologue.rpy	4933	[what]
prologue_dyre_53a9a0dd		I ran away right after lunch to avoid my parents.	game/prologue.rpy	4950	[what]
prologue_dyre_f29a3564		It wouldn't be unheard of for me to get pulled out of school in the middle of the day, but I wonder...	game/prologue.rpy	4951	[what]
prologue_dyre_ba1533fd		That's weird, why would a homeroom teacher from another class be spreading rumors about someone else's students?	game/prologue.rpy	4955	[what]
prologue_dyre_b9b7e70a		He was the one who showed me that paper in the first place.	game/prologue.rpy	4999	[what]
prologue_dyre_eb3b9062		I should have known better than to talk to him.	game/prologue.rpy	5003	[what]
prologue_dyre_0acfaa5f		Of course he doesn't get it. Even if I agreed with him, he'd just flip sides and argue the opposite.	game/prologue.rpy	5021	[what]
prologue_dyre_5c7cead1		I'm not going to fall for this. I know they're lying about the Junior Gladiators, that my friends and I are here.	game/prologue.rpy	5057	[what]
prologue_dyre_c6c1c0e6		There's probably other stuff about the DVP they're covering up too.	game/prologue.rpy	5058	[what]
prologue_dyre_4dce2856		He's just... trying to get under my skin and get me to say something I shouldn't.	game/prologue.rpy	5059	[what]
prologue_dyre_cf903d92		I mean, there's no way this place is actually haunted, right?	game/prologue.rpy	5060	[what]
prologue_dyre_bc067499		He wanders off, waving goodbye over his shoulder as he goes.	game/prologue.rpy	5069	[what]
prologue_dyre_db6a12b6		I really don't want to stick around, not that I believed a word he said. I should look elsewhere.	game/prologue.rpy	5070	[what]
prologue_jona_5b706e31		I follow a paved walkway behind the field to a sparsely wooded area.	game/prologue.rpy	5078	[what]
prologue_jona_0c660a8d		Hidden behind rows of planters is a small concrete stage	game/prologue.rpy	5079	[what]
prologue_jona_4bb7f300		It looks like it hasn't been long since the poppies were watered. The earth smells damp and cool.	game/prologue.rpy	5080	[what]
prologue_jona_f54e1399		Someone's staring at me. They aren't coming any closer, but they aren't looking away either.	game/prologue.rpy	5086	[what]
prologue_jona_9d1055e6		With all the junk covering their face, it's impossible to tell what they're thinking.	game/prologue.rpy	5087	[what]
prologue_jona_006dc00b		Creepy.	game/prologue.rpy	5091	[what]
prologue_jona_85241d9d		That makes more sense. Jona was the most withdrawn and awkward member of our gang.	game/prologue.rpy	5111	[what]
prologue_jona_feae876e		Looks like he covered himself head to toe the moment he got a chance. That explains why he's so calm right now.	game/prologue.rpy	5112	[what]
prologue_jona_013ebdc9		Jona has a habit of repurposing things for art without knowing what they are.	game/prologue.rpy	5125	[what]
prologue_jona_25b84596		He had tried inventing things, but always valued aesthetics over functionality.	game/prologue.rpy	5126	[what]
prologue_jona_19f5ecba		There's one right answer.	game/prologue.rpy	5131	[what]
prologue_jona_cd92098d		Just let it go, Nagen. You don't want to go down that road again.	game/prologue.rpy	5179	[what]
prologue_jona_7e8b896b		Somehow, that's more unsettling.	game/prologue.rpy	5210	[what]
prologue_jona_e0203492		I know he's not talking about me when he goes off on tangents like this.	game/prologue.rpy	5215	[what]
prologue_jona_175d8a6b		I rarely hung out with Jona one on one. For one, this is the kid that carved up desks for fun.	game/prologue.rpy	5243	[what]
prologue_jona_07b5fb27		The other was, well, he reminds me of my mom for some reason...	game/prologue.rpy	5244	[what]
prologue_jona_3f79b213		He tries to hide the notebooks in his bag.	game/prologue.rpy	5259	[what]
prologue_jona_a0552b89		This is just one of those things I have to let go of, I think.	game/prologue.rpy	5281	[what]
Meeting_d10819e5		I walk into the room to find Hiro and Jona waiting for me. Uitto comes in silently behind me.	game/prologue.rpy	5315	[what]
Meeting_2741fca6		The last time we were all together, it was to tell everyone that Lethe had passed.	game/prologue.rpy	5316	[what]
Meeting_ba2c71cf		Hiro doesn't look surprised, but he's definitely avoiding Jona's almost accusatory turn towards him.	game/prologue.rpy	5370	[what]
Meeting_c896209e		It's hard to tell with the goggles. Uitto keeps glaring at me.	game/prologue.rpy	5371	[what]
Meeting_5fd39845		She leaves without another word.	game/prologue.rpy	5560	[what]
Meeting_f6811986		Has she been crying?	game/prologue.rpy	5621	[what]
Meeting_f33471b9		So she isn't actually mad at me. I guess that's good, but I'm still worried.	game/prologue.rpy	5647	[what]
meet_main_cdff4b5d		I managed to get the guys to agree to join me. They may question my methods, but at least they're on board.	game/prologue.rpy	5655	[what]
meet_main_3ded0b5f		As for Uitto... I know we're all upset getting shoved into reform school, but it didn't seem like she had a better idea than mine.	game/prologue.rpy	5656	[what]
meet_main_10b19df6		I can't postpone returning to my dorm any longer.	game/prologue.rpy	5657	[what]
meet_main_b2030244		Part of my aversion comes from how barren and sterile the rooms are.	game/prologue.rpy	5661	[what]
meet_main_ad8bef87		I'd compare this place to a prison, but at least prisons are fully indoors.	game/prologue.rpy	5662	[what]
meet_main_61b04c6e		I guess public opinion on Proficiency-centered education is dwindling because we're all having to stay in musty portable buildings.	game/prologue.rpy	5663	[what]
meet_main_3725422b		I hope it's well-ventilated. I cringe to think of how hot this place could get in the summer.	game/prologue.rpy	5664	[what]
meet_main_1f9efe68		I don't have the energy to unpack yet. I shrug out off my jacket and collapse on the bare mattress.	game/prologue.rpy	5665	[what]
meet_main_11024f39		As I drift off to sleep, I desperately try to convince myself everything will work out in the end.	game/prologue.rpy	5666	[what]

Hiro1_0da39bfe		He was our self proclaimed leader, a real ass about it, but he did a good job of keeping us safe when things went south. It also helped that he knew how to cook.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	74	[what]
Hiro1_d1411a29		He does have a point. I only have to read something once to learn it. The only time I have to drill stuff is if I learned it incorrectly the first time.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	94	[what]
Hiro1_bfa04005		I’m really worried about him. If he can’t figure out what he wants to do, it won’t matter whether or not he gets out of this mess.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	105	[what]
Hiro1_582c635f		This was a mistake.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	133	[what]
Hiro1_852b6492		He pressed a button on his phone with a wicked grin.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	143	[what]
Hiro1_7d3fd05b		He ran off before I could catch him. He’s going to be guarding that stupid thing like his life depended on it.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	152	[what]
Hiro1_bc3fab1c		He glared at me.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	172	[what]
Hiro1_5ee74911		I’m not historically the best in high pressure situations.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	187	[what]
Hiro1_c9df4446		Though to be fair, at the time I was twelve, my teammates were missing and I was lost in a war zone.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	188	[what]
Hiro1_3ee7742a		So I’d appreciate if he gave me a little more credit.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	189	[what]
Hiro1_f54de35d		Easy for him to say. And again, more credit would be appreciated.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	193	[what]
Hiro1_44548517		I had to help him pull his arm out of the bottom of a vending machine before any staff found us. It’s strange, even years later, I still end up being his handler.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	205	[what]
Hiro1_212e0872		If he expects me to do this out of school, he needs to start paying me.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	206	[what]
Hiro2_0df0ee21		He hasn’t given up on that?	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	221	[what]
Hiro2_89dc08c9		I mean, he’s not wrong, but at the same time, I don’t feel like he’s quite getting the whole picture here.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	235	[what]
Hiro2_437853b5		I forgot how literal he can be.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	261	[what]
Hiro2_5dfd6ec1		What’s gotten into him?	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	284	[what]
Hiro2_5a344b4e		I shouldn’t have asked that. If I had thought about it for even a second, I wouldn’t have.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	326	[what]
Hiro2_35eacbea		He opened the window, I had enough time to acknowledge we were on the third floor before he picked me up and jumped out.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	327	[what]
Hiro2_4f13b085		We hit the water and everything left my mind except the need for air.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	337	[what]
Hiro2_ad0991b3		When we finally breached the surface, I thrashed blindly around trying to hit him	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	338	[what]
Hiro2_b7e2e806		I sloshed out of the pool with an embarrassing squelch.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	353	[what]
Hiro2_4ebda1c4		I really can’t stay mad at him. He means well, but we can’t keep doing stupid stuff like this.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	359	[what]
Hiro2_2ae668db		This was a very expensive jacket.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	360	[what]
Hiro3_9304aeb7		He lead me to the practice field.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	368	[what]
Hiro3_edc8aae6		Along the back fence was a pile of old timber, likely from when they gutted the interior of the building.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	369	[what]
Hiro3_fcf041c9		It was just tall enough that Hiro was able to pull himself over the top of the fence.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	370	[what]
Hiro3_e5242624		I’m not sure leaving school grounds is the best idea.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	374	[what]
Hiro3_20009f98		He left without me.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	387	[what]
Hiro3_96a60287		I stumbled after him for about fifteen minutes through the woods before we finally reached the city surrounding our school.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	396	[what]
Hiro3_11eb8df2		At any other academy, you’d be able to take trips into town to go out to eat or shop. But this place…	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	397	[what]
Hiro3_a92ebccb		He sat down amongst the wreckage, I soon followed suit.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	403	[what]
Hiro3_c6e5e38b		I used to think Hiro was a clumsy, obnoxious idiot. He’s still obnoxious, but the other things weren’t his fault.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	409	[what]
Hiro3_546a2452		He may have forgotten how many times he told us he fell down stairs, but I didn’t.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	410	[what]
Hiro3_4d7be149		I looked back at what remained of the town.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	422	[what]
Hiro3_9f969564		When the world is collapsing all around you, it’s hard to picture anything else.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	423	[what]
Hiro3_38f7c8b5		I’ve been running around trying to pin the blame on someone, but that isn’t going to get me anywhere.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	424	[what]
Hiro3_ad28ce67		I want things to change, but do I have to change myself to do it?	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	425	[what]
Hiro3_83fa4b5c		I’m pretty sure that apocalypse hit everywhere, but it’s a nice thought.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	503	[what]
Hiro3_687417bb		I believed what we did was necessary, righteous even, but I wouldn’t classify it as heroic.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	519	[what]
Hiro3_8f78063f		Last I checked, leading a city under the martial law of a brain washed horde was not in the hero commandments.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	520	[what]
Hiro3_3331ffb7		Not that there are hero commandments, but if there were, it wouldn’t be one of them. There really should be-	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	521	[what]
Hiro4_b62b004a		I feel insulted; but I have no way to prove he said what I think he said.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	545	[what]
Hiro4_d06899ac		Hunh?	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	567	[what]
Hiro4_4c841e27		He stared at me like I was a lunatic.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	574	[what]
Hiro4_c06507db		I know logically this doesn’t change anything. We were just dumb kids, and she’s gone, but still if I had known…	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	589	[what]
Hiro4_e1783ef1		I didn’t mean to make him feel bad.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	595	[what]
Hiro4_cc102c48		He took a deep breath. After a while, he couldn’t look me in the eye.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	614	[what]
Hiro4_5adf763b		He finally looked at me.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	618	[what]
Hiro4_85269204		This is a joke, right? I mean, there’s no way. I try laughing, but it doesn’t make any of this less awkward.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	626	[what]
Hiro4_391a82e2		I shouldn’t be this surprised. I just never thought about this sort of thing.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	638	[what]
Hiro4_06b5a182		Odori was everything I thought I was supposed to want; pretty, intelligent, and demure. We fought endlessly to be in the spotlight of her stage.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	639	[what]
Hiro4_46898c87		I was looked back on those days with fondness, but is it because of her… or him?	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	640	[what]
Hiro4_f8642206		Please tell me this isn’t a thing. I really don’t have time to deal with this right now.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	650	[what]
Hiro4_18680cca		A wave of relief washed over me, but I could tell he was disappointed.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	654	[what]
Hiro4_d2de2f8b		We laughed, unable to keep up the pace.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	677	[what]
Hiro4_305452d3		It’s not exactly what I expected, but I’m glad he’s found something he wants to do.	game/text/hiro_pathway.rpy	694	[what]
Jona1_f11e03f4		I find Jona sketching in the corner of the school’s cafe. At this point, it’s safe to say he lives here more than his dorm.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	19	[what]
Jona1_25bb705a		He sets down his pen and leans back in his chair with a hefty sigh. His arms go limp at his sides.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	31	[what]
Jona1_40584051		I try to get a look, but he slams the notebook shut.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	37	[what]
Jona1_d40987a9		He opens a large pot of ink and splatters the paper.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	58	[what]
Jona1_dc3054fd		He shakes his head. I had the misfortune to meet his mom once. It was on a day he was supposed to go to the doctor and he forgot to go straight home.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	63	[what]
Jona1_a64eb584		I’d never seen someone so unkempt before, it was like she left her hair in a ponytail twenty-four seven.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	64	[what]
Jona1_bd8c57d3		She brutally chewed him out in front of all of us and said our ‘stupid’ club was a waste of time.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	65	[what]
Jona1_d2d19581		He starts laughing his ass off.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	69	[what]
Jona1_4e280902		It looks like he’s having trouble finding the words.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	92	[what]
Jona2_b119d75e		I haven’t been able to find Jona in any of his usual haunting grounds.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	173	[what]
Jona2_e0f6c5bb		Suddenly, a large clatter sounds from behind the theater stage. I can hear someone rooting around in the garbage. It can’t be...	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	174	[what]
Jona2_fbd3d257		I follow the sound and sure enough, my childhood friend is dumpster diving.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	175	[what]
Jona2_6bb72fed		The poor sap startles and hits his head on the lid.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	179	[what]
Jona2_47a33796		Or when he’s not the one to plant them.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	184	[what]
Jona2_04c7b235		He leaps out with something in hand.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	211	[what]
Jona2_968baeea		He proudly displays a dismembered porcelain ballerina atop a glass case.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	217	[what]
Jona2_1bf1c449		He winds up the machine. A warped melody is released from the contraption.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	221	[what]
Jona2_01f1e63f		I’m going to end up fighting in the garbage if I’m not careful. Just where does this asshole get off insinuating that I’m pessimistic?	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	257	[what]
Jona2_b95365b9		He won’t be so smug when his stupid mask is shattered against the pavement.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	261	[what]
Jona2_0672fa07		That makes a little more sense.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	270	[what]
Jona2_a9e2d855		I hate being wrong. Why is the internet out of my reach at a time like this?	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	303	[what]
Jona2_43297987		I get up to leave, but I’m sent sailing into the dirt by one of his trip wires.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	340	[what]
Jona2_d853df70		I don’t think we’ll ever fully agree on the matter, but at least I can convince him to forgo booby-trapping the dumpsters. For someone so harmless, he can be a real handful.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	348	[what]
Jona3_aab3fe89		Jona invited me to hang out in his dorm room while he works on fixing up the old music box we found.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	355	[what]
Jona3_20f8a8f1		His room looks more like a workshop with all the disassembled junk he had strewn about.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	356	[what]
Jona3_84e10810		While poking around his collection, I find a half finished 3D puzzle to mess around with.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	357	[what]
Jona3_5a0382d2		He fumbles with his tools. What an odd thing to get flustered over.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	374	[what]
Jona3_2fdafd24		He can’t seriously be thinking of conning this woman, is he?	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	392	[what]
Jona3_98cfb16d		It has been a couple years since started hiding his face like that. I wonder...	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	458	[what]
Jona3_8003918c		I don’t have anything I can say. All my friends have been worrying about the future and there’s nothing I can do to fix it, fine.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	491	[what]
Jona3_93eff90c		He can enjoy his junk and I’ll find a way out of this mess on my own.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	492	[what]
Jona4_c3175044		I hadn’t hung out with Jona after he got all weird about asking me for help with his family issues.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	500	[what]
Jona4_01ac1188		I have enough on my plate without adding some manufactured rhetoric about how I butt into other people’s business.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	501	[what]
Jona4_11d59065		So it’s really weird having him seek me out for a change.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	502	[what]
Jona4_bc7f2fdc		I punch him in the face. His decora shit slices open my knuckles though, so I’d call it even. He apparently doesn’t.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	524	[what]
Jona4_6049c42d		The wind is knocked out of me as his shoulder collides with my stomach. He pins down my right arm with his boot, waiting for me to catch my breath.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	528	[what]
Jona4_58425669		It hurts to breathe. I may not be built for combat, but like hell am I giving up.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	532	[what]
Jona4_7d54958a		He’s so focused on keeping my shoulder pinned that I’m able to shake my leg around his other foot to knock him to the ground.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	536	[what]
Jona4_30f74afe		I hear something shatter next to me and a string of curses from Jona.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	537	[what]
Jona4_f4bedf96		I really don’t have a good argument against that; he’s right. Having some mousey kid follow us around was a nice ego boost. We mostly included him in our plans to give him something to do.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	543	[what]
Jona4_6d411993		At least that gets him laughing. Only for a bit though, his laughter stopping the instant he sees his goggles shattered on the ground.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	547	[what]
Jona4_fabe2c0c		He frantically gathers the pieces, intermittently checking the integrity of his mask. Unfortunately for him, I’ve already seen what he was trying to hide.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	553	[what]
Jona4_7d57c2ba		He looked normal to me. A little better than normal, actually. It’s a little hard to tell with that stupid mask blocking the rest of his face.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	557	[what]
Jona4_28c3f7ac		Why can’t he put his hands down for five seconds?	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	563	[what]
Jona4_f316f2b2		I reluctantly tear my eyes away. I’m normally one to stare. What has gotten into me?	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	567	[what]
Jona4_5744de8c		There’s only one person I’ve ever heard of who had a Proficiency that worked that way; the infamous Siren.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	579	[what]
Jona4_b01a8f4e		But Siren was a tragic and fragile figure in the history of the Karmic Gladiators and Jona’s mom was...	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	580	[what]
Jona4_0abe7d83		Well, there’s no delicate way to put it, she was crazy. Could they really be the same person?	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	581	[what]
Jona4_0fa1aafd		Here we are indeed. At this time last year, I thought I’d be ruling my own city. Instead, I’m in high school.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	623	[what]
Jona4_0a060a88		He straps on his busted goggles and sighs in defeat. Only one lens in still in place, though it’s obscured by a spider web of breaks.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	631	[what]
Jona4_095cb5e4		I’m not used to seeing Jona so morose. It’s unsettling.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	671	[what]
Jona5_595b152c		Today I have to help Jona paint sets for an upcoming dance recital. Well, technically I don’t have to, I’ve chosen to. It’s the least I can do after breaking his goggles.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	684	[what]
Jona5_bf93a40a		He has me painting all the built pieces with base coats while he constructs the rest.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	685	[what]
Jona5_bd1e360e		Jona is the least realistic person I know. I’ve never seen him so certain something would go wrong.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	735	[what]
Jona5_949ecd6f		I can’t even laugh at the absurdity of all this. I just feel tired and numb thinking about ending up at the back end of this.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	741	[what]
Jona5_9214c33a		He finishes hammering the last nail on a giant rolling staircase.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	820	[what]
Jona5_d6c0d1fb		I’m not surprised he’s finished building it before I’m done painting, but I’m a little offended that he expects me to finish it today.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	821	[what]
Jona5_cfc868f4		It’s times like these that I’m glad I have a photographic memory. I’ll only be glancing at the assigned reading tonight.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	827	[what]
JonaF_036c84ba		Jona sent me a text saying he was too busy to hang out right now.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	832	[what]
JonaF_aa9205bd		I guess I'll see him later.	game/text/jona_pathway.rpy	833	[what]
MarikoP1_65d5218b		I know Mariko said she didn’t want any trouble from me, but I wonder if she’s doing alright.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	19	[what]
MarikoP1_682405e8		It wouldn’t hurt to drop by and say hi, would it? During lunch break, I found her on the practice field with a gaggle of other girls.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	20	[what]
MarikoP1_738ad901		It seems like she was able to gather enough participants to start the Cheer Squad.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	21	[what]
MarikoP1_477d4a4c		I needed to get food anyways. I came back later, when practice was over.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	40	[what]
MarikoP1_115723bb		I think I hit a nerve.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	55	[what]
MarikoP1_db7b56a0		S-soft!?	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	63	[what]
MarikoP1_6105a094		That really doesn’t sound healthy. I don’t think I’m going to convince her otherwise.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	67	[what]
MarikoP1_dcea28a3		The rest of the period she lectured me about how tired she was of people assuming Cheerleaders didn’t have to work hard; including her squad members.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	68	[what]
MarikoP1_88073219		How do you forget to eat? It looks like she brought something though. It’s just a thing of plain spaghetti.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	74	[what]
MarikoP1_43c1e012		So that’s why they’re practicing so hard.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	83	[what]
MarikoP1_40540694		She sounds so defeated. It probably doesn’t help that the cafeteria closes up at the end of lunch. How long does she expect to keep going like this?	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	90	[what]
MarikoP1_76d5f913		Somehow, I got roped into being a gopher for the Cheer Squad.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	105	[what]
MarikoP1_fcdbeea5		She looked at me with a blank stare. I don’t know why; I expected a slightly positive reaction.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	111	[what]
MarikoP1_dc32d887		She seemed, defeated in a way. Maybe it was because she just finished practice that she looked so exhausted.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	115	[what]
MarikoP1_149a94dc		She half laughed, not meeting my eyes.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	121	[what]
MarikoP1_3878dc7e		She closed her eyes and took slow, shallow breaths. I waited patiently for her to respond.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	143	[what]
MarikoP1_de06630a		She mulled that over as well.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	150	[what]
MarikoP1_4c06e5af		Granted, it was a gross exaggeration of the problem, but ten minutes is not enough time to tell anyone’s life story.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	151	[what]
Mariko2P_9a5877cc		After she finished barking her orders I got swarmed.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	176	[what]
Mariko2P_0fb6d54b		She grimaced.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	191	[what]
Mariko2P_68068fd9		She looked so disturbed.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	202	[what]
Mariko2P_c4cdab45		There wasn’t exactly a home to go back to either.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	242	[what]
Mariko2P_8299ae47		It’s hard to imagine running around that long looking for the deceased to return to rubble. Like a morbid Captain Ahab.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	243	[what]
Mariko2P_4cca0ad6		She was tense, defensive, and likely picked up on what I had in mind.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	254	[what]
Mariko2P_66aaf5be		Genki by nature was stubborn as hellfire, my life could be easier down the road if she was on my side.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	255	[what]
Mariko2P_fdd253cb		She tugged at her earring as she faltered.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	261	[what]
Mariko2P_a66517c9		She breathed a long, reserved sigh of relief.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	273	[what]
Mariko2P_91153ee6		My exit out of that conversation was as graceful as my leave off the field.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	301	[what]
Mariko3P_496ea1a4		The exercise clothes I borrowed from Hiro were easily a size too big.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	313	[what]
Mariko3P_c35c471a		The longer I stood there, the more the girls stared at me. Or at least at the stains on this borrowed shirt.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	314	[what]
Mariko3P_86a80d82		Even if they’re not my mustard stains, I can’t help but feel incredibly uncomfortable.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	315	[what]
Mariko3P_fb542118		She turned to face the girls.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	319	[what]
Mariko3P_8de0a88f		Against my better judgement, I followed Genki’s orders.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	327	[what]
Mariko3P_1b06a92c		Not.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	333	[what]
Mariko3P_efd3a09b		She burst out laughing, which was doubly insulting considering she was folded like a pretzel while I contemplated the least embarrassing way I could stand up from this.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	334	[what]
Mariko3P_0f2439c8		With a surprising amount of strength, she hoisted me onto my knees. I may or may not have fallen on my face when she let me go.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	344	[what]
Mariko3P_22f136a9		She rolled her eyes, but I seriously need some ice.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	348	[what]
Mariko3P_61e7683d		They reply with zeal like always, but I know what I’ve seen.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	370	[what]
Mariko3P_4644691c		She doesn’t look fine. There’s a melancholic air about her that she just can’t seem to shake. I can’t tell if I’m helping or making it worse.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	382	[what]
Mariko3P_f8a19682		There’s always time for sarcasm. I am a seven layer bean dip of sarcasm.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	393	[what]
Mariko3P_3fb82909		She flushed bright red.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	397	[what]
Mariko3P_885d8680		She hung her head in shame looking incredibly guilty.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	408	[what]
Mariko3P_572bc86f		All I could do is laugh.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	412	[what]
Mariko3P_5832fe38		Her energy’s dropped way down. I think I’ve hit a little too close to home.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	421	[what]
Mariko3P_75e530af		At least she’s feeling better, but it meant 10 laps around the field.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	430	[what]
Mariko3P_a9cea351		I used to be the same way. I poured myself into my work and shut out the world around me. It isn’t a healthy way to deal with your problems.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	443	[what]
Mariko3P_bf0b3967		She watched the girls practice with a combination of longing and mourning.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	449	[what]
Mariko3P_75cc78d8		Her laugh sounded empty.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	458	[what]
Mariko3P_8264f569		She ran off desperate to grab something from the cafeteria before they closed.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	484	[what]
MarikoP4_61de0a7c		After the last time we talked, I started dropping by Mariko’s cheer practice a couple times a week.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	491	[what]
MarikoP4_36bf8cc9		It was surprisingly vigorous all things considered. All of us had improved quite a bit since the beginning of the year, but she still wasn’t satisfied with the results.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	492	[what]
MarikoP4_cde6f6d8		I’ve been coming here for weeks now, and I’m still only barely able to follow what she says.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	500	[what]
MarikoP4_077e69dc		She rolled her eyes.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	504	[what]
MarikoP4_4d01dfa3		I followed her instructions. It was clumsy, but I managed to stand up with the added weight.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	514	[what]
MarikoP4_e7cb06d0		My back might murder me tomorrow though, she’s heavier than she looks.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	515	[what]
MarikoP4_466aae62		I felt a heavy weight against the back of my head. I could see her arms dangle on either side of my peripheral vision, her chin dug into my skull.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	519	[what]
MarikoP4_d0a04602		She felt warm… Too warm. Why isn’t she moving? What’s going on!?	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	523	[what]
MarikoP4_3e90e0ac		I set her down as gently as I could, she wasn’t moving.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	529	[what]
MarikoP4_8f16c1fe		They told me that she was probably dehydrated and under slept	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	535	[what]
MarikoP4_82a7e417		Which, I guess makes sense, but how did she get this bad? Was she forgetting to drink too?	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	536	[what]
MarikoP4_7717b574		How can someone so outwardly lively just not take care of themselves like this?	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	537	[what]
MarikoP4_139ad32e		My concern only grew when she woke up bawling her eyes out.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	538	[what]
MarikoP4_d9d3fed2		She sat up instantly, eyes wide with fear.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	542	[what]
MarikoP4_760bf4d8		She laughed that horrid, hollow laugh.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	552	[what]
MarikoP4_d776b96b		As if that wasn’t scary enough, now she’s shouting things in her sleep.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	558	[what]
MarikoP4_8bf6fd77		She was crying again, but at least this time she was talking to me and not the wall.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	584	[what]
MarikoP4_4df5a973		I waited patiently for her to continue.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	623	[what]
MarikoP4_b22ccb1b		Wait a minute, Hiro went back to Estella? That doesn’t seem right.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	629	[what]
MarikoP4_9755a755		Excuse me? Where does she get off talking to me like this?	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	672	[what]
MarikoP4_8bd71be2		She dragged herself out of the cot and left me behind.	game/text/mariko_pathway.rpy	680	[what]
Nanase1_cabf9d5d		She stared at me expectantly, and a little lost. To be fair, I might have looked the same way. I should probably say something.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	23	[what]
Nanase1_e9ec5ee1		She faltered and tried to back track.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	38	[what]
Nanase1_aa220968		Her energy deflated before she finished her sentence.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	43	[what]
Nanase1_82df2bbc		She stares at me blankly.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	65	[what]
Nanase1_b0ccfd67		She stalled for time as long as she could.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	88	[what]
Nanase1_f89bb800		She picked up on my confusion.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	96	[what]
Nanase1_0ea8d801		She bit her lip and avoided my eyes.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	104	[what]
Nanase1_c8be2dd6		Her shoulders slumped as she spoke.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	108	[what]
Nanase1_f6a63211		I want to ask her why, but it seems personal.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	112	[what]
Nanase1_19b524d0		We hooked up my laptop to the classroom projector and watched Shanghai Bouncer. Lots of B-grade action scenes and pandas.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	118	[what]
Nanase1_df996bc8		She doesn't understand. The people who'd be coming for me wouldn't be your average bullies. The person doing this could very well be a threat to everyone.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	132	[what]
Nanase1_88f9fba0		She glared at me, almost about to cry. I don't think I've ever seen her this mad before. I mean, yeah I was kinda rude, but nothing deserving of such a steely glare. She stormed off without anothing word.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	136	[what]
Nanase2_a836cf7f		Ouch, looks like she's still mad about earlier. She turned her back on me and continued shredding documents. ...Wait a minute, shredding documents?	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	144	[what]
Nanase2_fd1ed524		I picked up a form from the pile.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	146	[what]
Nanase2_1e832a0b		It was one of those student request forms. Whoever filled it out requested that I jump off the roof of the school.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	150	[what]
Nanase2_fc51a92c		She struggled to change the subject.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	158	[what]
Nanase2_89d11e54		In a flash, her confidence evaporated.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	188	[what]
Nanase2_226321d2		Wait a minute- does she not know?	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	239	[what]
Nanase2_4713dc61		She shuddered, rejecting the idea with every fiber of her being.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	265	[what]
Nanase2_47a1d782		I'm not going to botch a chance at being perceived as normal over winning an argument... yet.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	282	[what]
Nanase3_69c7c635		She doesn't seem even remotely impressed.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	312	[what]
Nanase3_d72fe9b2		Her eyes lit up.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	318	[what]
Nanase3_0976db48		She was talking at a mile a minute, but I'm guessing my eyes started to glaze over or something, because she's slowed down.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	325	[what]
Nanase3_29049f0e		I set up in the library with butcher paper and a handful of 'borrowed' markers from the council room.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	337	[what]
Nanase3_1571fa5b		Harsh, and she's the one who started it. Nagging me out of the blue like that, what gives?	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	421	[what]
Nanase3_820abfa3		Even if we don't always get along, the past few days I've spent with Nanase have felt surprisingly normal.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	423	[what]
Nanase3_9fd12f2e		After everything that happened, I hadn't expected to be able to just hang out with someone and work on school stuff again.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	424	[what]
Nanase3_1da131e5		Still, I haven't exactly been up front about why I'm here. I can't keep pretending it's because I don't know how to start.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	425	[what]
Nanase3_62bad68c		Oh, so she does know.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	431	[what]
Nanase3_1beae214		I'm still trying to figure out where to go from here, but it's moments like these that are nice.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	452	[what]
Nanase4_e0c65811		Nanase and I worked on our posters for a good couple hours, preparing for speeches and public speaking in general.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	458	[what]
Nanase4_a4618ded		Nanase's had a border of panda stickers and some crudely drawn books on her adverts. I tried my best to keep my letters the same size on the stupid thing.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	459	[what]
Nanase4_446e3697		She's been talking about Shanghai Bouncer non-stop since she got here. Unless I want a five paragraph essay on Pandeku's season three character arch I need to change the subject.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	464	[what]
Nanase4_7c7f4d47		I guess it's a step in the right direction, but something about what she said seemed off.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	545	[what]
Nanase4_6f5f4d65		In all the scenarios I had run through my head of how she'd react, I never imagined her crying.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	559	[what]
Nanase4_9efe6c48		I really didn't know what else to say at that point. I just kinda stood there, feeling useless while she calmed down.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	579	[what]
Nanase4_8bf1d04b		She repeated it softly, reaffirming what I feel like I've repeated a few times now.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	583	[what]
Nanase4_099f67f9		Nanase's always been a little codependent around me.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	619	[what]
Nanase4_29cecefc		I had just written it off as a side effect of having a limited number of friends.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	620	[what]
Nanase4_4a216b83		I hadn't considered it was something she was self conscious about.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	621	[what]
Nanase4_3abe56bd		I watched as all emotion drained from her face. She stared at me blankly, maybe thinking something over, I'm not sure.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	627	[what]
Nanase4_9cd9e9a9		I mean, that's good I guess, but what the hell was all that?	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	647	[what]
NanaseF_0522cc12		Nagase must be busy right now.	game/text/nanase_pathway.rpy	655	[what]
Uitto1_61032865		I can’t keep not talking to Uitto about how she stopped wanting to have anything to do with me. I mean, theoretically I could, but not knowing will drive me bananas.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	21	[what]
Uitto1_193cb761		Now, how do I approach her without pissing her off?	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	22	[what]
Uitto1_9400c0d1		I’m not a big fan of being used. It’s times like this I wish I was more eloquent when upset.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	149	[what]
Uitto1_f429a189		Even if she’s just being paranoid, she has a point.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	164	[what]
Uitto1_29ee80a7		I’ll make sure to cover anything that looks remotely like a camera lens tonight.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	165	[what]
Uitto2_519dac8b		Ever since I’ve talked to Uitto, I’ve been more careful about what I say and who I say it to.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	172	[what]
Uitto2_5f8e338b		Things seem to have gone back to normal with us.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	173	[what]
Uitto2_3e00dac6		Despite all that, she still holds onto the title as her superhero alias.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	207	[what]
Uitto2_86444b81		Maybe years of living that lifestyle makes it hard to quit.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	208	[what]
Uitto2_2e3da428		She says so with icy conviction. I knew they were the reason she joined us, but I never asked her about it.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	215	[what]
Uitto2_f494aa93		The stuff I was forced to take growing up wrecked me.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	228	[what]
Uitto2_04c38899		There’s barely any research, let alone guidelines, for making Proficiency-based drugs.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	229	[what]
Uitto2_d32f31f2		I wouldn't trust anyone who was trying to take peoples’ powers away.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	230	[what]
Uitto2_997dade8		She has stopped listening to reason. She’s downright unreasonable.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	299	[what]
Uitto2_391e877f		I’ve created a monster.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	304	[what]
Uitto3_949af81d		She glares at me with a thin frown.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	316	[what]
Uitto3_b9375c58		I skim through the scene. The dialogue is pretty sappy.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	331	[what]
Uitto3_ef995c75		I don’t see how anyone can take this seriously. Granted, my well known bias against romantic dramas probably affects my decision.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	332	[what]
Uitto3_cc6f02d6		I take a knee and extend my arm to the sky.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	346	[what]
Uitto3_78631c18		In my worst attempt at a British accent, I proclaim...	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	347	[what]
Uitto3_71126069		Nailed it.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	351	[what]
Uitto3_d94fc359		She shields her face with her script.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	355	[what]
Uitto3_79d259a6		She’s trying her hardest not to laugh.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	362	[what]
Uitto3_dbb5073d		She flips back a few pages.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	386	[what]
Uitto3_06398373		She sighs.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	443	[what]
Uitto3_4f53ee57		I never took her for the type to quit like that. She’s always been so headstrong. This is a little creepy.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	447	[what]
Uitto3_fbebb083		And now I’ve made her uncomfortable. Great, fantastic job.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	464	[what]
Uitto4_1609dc5a		It’s been really hard to get a chance to hang out with Uitto. Everytime I asked, she was busy.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	476	[what]
Uitto4_5a7f5581		Finally, she texted me to meet her on the tennis court.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	477	[what]
Uitto4_6c4b4b2b		She’s practicing her backhand swing.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	478	[what]
Uitto4_49021e31		It reminds me of our days on the battlefield. She wields her racket with the same ferocity she did with an ax.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	479	[what]
Uitto4_544dc36a		I can kind of understand that. Growing up, my one goal was to make my father happy. It was a fruitless venture, but that didn’t stop me from trying.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	531	[what]
Uitto4_06663d04		It got to the point where even if he wasn’t watching, I was still acting like he was.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	532	[what]
Uitto4_0bc7db9d		She laughs.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	538	[what]
Uitto4_bd8db96f		She’s quiet for a long time. The ball she was ramming against the wall rolls lifelessly along the ground.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	543	[what]
Uitto4_c0235d1a		She picks up the ball and tosses it in the air, catching it in her hand.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	547	[what]
Uitto4_586ca0b0		She smacks the ball with her racket.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	563	[what]
Uitto4_fb83e8a2		She starts laughing.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	570	[what]
Uitto4_6de32d11		I expect her to keep laughing. Instead, she becomes rather somber.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	576	[what]
Uitto4_9eac5ce7		Wait a minute...	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	618	[what]
Uitto4_0bc7db9d_1		She laughs.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	634	[what]
Uitto5_ec535c30		I believed Uitto when she said she’d figure something out.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	643	[what]
Uitto5_eddfa01e		For as long as I’ve known her, she’s always had something in the works.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	644	[what]
Uitto5_4ae74de8		However, over the last few days, she’s been rather quiet. After everything that’s happened, I expected her to be more determined than ever to find her own path, but it’s almost like she’s given up.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	645	[what]
Uitto5_8e586510		I followed her instructions to the letter. I found her waiting for me, backpack in hand.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	668	[what]
Uitto5_5de10491		She pulls at the bottom corner of the chain link fence. It was probably loose before she came here, but it’s still amazing how easily she rolls up the metal.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	672	[what]
Uitto5_24471284		With a wave of her hand, she ushers me to follow her through the opening.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	673	[what]
Uitto5_963eab9a		I dig my heels into the soft earth, but she keeps pulling me further away.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	689	[what]
Uitto5_074c2065		I am extremely uncomfortable around people when they’re crying. It makes me painfully aware of my hands.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	715	[what]
Uitto5_139506e0		I don’t know what to do with them and I have nothing helpful to say. I end up looking like a confused mime.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	716	[what]
Uitto5_3e3b7be9		Uitto also happens to be doing the kind of crying most people reserve for the bathroom. That broken sort of half-choking type of crying that holds you in place.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	717	[what]
Uitto5_ecae2069		She has a death grip on my wrist, like she’ll be swallowed by the ground if she lets go.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	718	[what]
Uitto5_e8c41a3c		Yes, be helpful. The sensible thing to do.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	724	[what]
Uitto5_62a241dd		Nooo! That’s the opposite of helpful, that’s patronizing!	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	728	[what]
Uitto5_8f961e8e		Yeah, just keep stating the obvious, dummy.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	732	[what]
Uitto5_7f1b0675		Cool, cool. Going good. Finish strong.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	737	[what]
Uitto5_2343251f		Okay, you don’t have to finish strong, just say something!	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	741	[what]
Uitto5_5663e8ba		Now she’s crying even more. Crap!	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	745	[what]
Uitto5_64d5896a		There isn’t much else to do at this point. With no idea how long it will take, I sit down next to her.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	756	[what]
Uitto5_fd95731e		We stayed that way for quite a while, her struggling to breathe and me waiting.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	757	[what]
Uitto5_23ec05d6		I’ve never seen Uitto look so vulnerable before. It kinda freaks me out seeing her break down like this.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	762	[what]
Uitto5_d972c635		I can’t just bail on her, but I don’t really know what else to do.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	763	[what]
Uitto5_d60b1c7a		So I just stand there speechless while she clings to my hand.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	764	[what]
Uitto5_a6fb97f9		She stands up and dusts herself off.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	768	[what]
Uitto5_0192fb33		Bitter as her words are, at least she’s laughing.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	776	[what]
Uitto5_a4705e87		She sighs	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	780	[what]
Uitto5_06398373		She sighs.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	782	[what]
Uitto5_451e96ea		Stop arguing, you’ll only dig yourself in deeper.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	817	[what]
Uitto5_8eb18cc0		She’s calmed down quite a bit.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	871	[what]
UittoF_cd969c3b		Uitto must be busy right now.	game/text/uitto_pathway.rpy	880	[what]
Yoku1_b15c6d44		I continued to map out the school grounds in my spare time.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	18	[what]
Yoku1_fe9b7109		The fourth floor consisted of vacant offices for the teachers and an archive room left over from when this place was a library.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	19	[what]
Yoku1_ef461f4a		The third floor was split between computer labs and electives classes.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	20	[what]
Yoku1_ece128e9		The rest of the central building just looked like regular classrooms. Hard to tell with most of the doors still locked.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	21	[what]
Yoku1_7a6eb33d		There was one thing that bothered me. The internal layout, it reminded me of Estella…	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	22	[what]
Yoku1_344120eb		What am I thinking? Of course it’s familiar, there’s only so many ways to build a school, why reinvent the wheel?	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	23	[what]
Yoku1_9f812cea		I’m just overthinking things.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	24	[what]
Yoku1_a905fd9d		I followed the sound to the back courtyard.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	30	[what]
Yoku1_aba8c12a		Oh, it’s that guy. Yoku sat playing a beat up violin.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	31	[what]
Yoku1_43d3368e		I’m begrudgingly amazed he can make it sound so incredible.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	32	[what]
Yoku1_510a1e83		He paused.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	33	[what]
Yoku1_33b5ccc1		He seemed hopeful for a moment, but then saw me.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	34	[what]
Yoku1_041af010		He put away his instrument with a sullen expression his face	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	45	[what]
Yoku1_7866e953		I’m getting the feeling he’d be just as angry at anyone else who wandered by.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	50	[what]
Yoku1_6aff47f5		How relative are we talking?	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	56	[what]
Yoku1_c4c79ab5		More power to him I guess.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	84	[what]
Yoku1_3ea5c65d		I get what he’s saying. I mean, I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for the hours I put into studying. Even still…	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	100	[what]
Yoku1_d51c0a26		Nevermind, I don’t get this guy. I’ve never spent every waking hour focused on one thing, not by choice at least.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	108	[what]
Yoku1_74b5e0aa		No witty comeback to that one I see.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	124	[what]
Yoku1_1bbc354a		That’s why he was so excited when I first showed up.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	128	[what]
Yoku1_9f4084fc		There might not be anyone to talk to if she was in the army.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	136	[what]
Yoku1_3540dbc4		He finished packing up his stuff with a sigh.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	142	[what]
Yoku1_51782c52		I don’t know what this guy expects of me.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	159	[what]
Yoku2_021a4a18		I should have known coming here was a mistake.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	165	[what]
Yoku2_1de566e9		Granted, I wasn’t given a choice, but that’s besides the point. I’m pretty sure the penitentiary wouldn’t be blasting wonky classical music at all hours.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	166	[what]
Yoku2_2d89727e		I storm down to the courtyard to give him a piece of my mind.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	170	[what]
Yoku2_a2d29e79		How can he talk about this so casually.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	207	[what]
Yoku2_892d66ef		So Yoku stuck in one of those Proficiency mills. That could have very easily been me.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	227	[what]
Yoku2_17c7f2da		He pulled out his instrument.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	245	[what]
Yoku2_62a918bb		He lowered his bow with a glare.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	251	[what]
Yoku2_30e9139f		I never programmed it to do that.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	265	[what]
Yoku2_eec266b6		I remembered Hiro's story about living in the shared rooms in the foster home. It still kinda bugs me.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	278	[what]
Yoku2_e6ff5a7a		He sighed. 	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	282	[what]
Yoku3_fbf780e2		Last time I talked to him, Yoku mentioned that his grandparents weren’t well off, but I’m certain he was a part of those uppercrust Proficiency mills. I wonder how he ended up there.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	294	[what]
Yoku3_3bf1695e		Gross. No wonder this guy talks about himself all the time.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	313	[what]
Yoku3_6ebc4995		I started laughing, I couldn’t help it, picturing some snob disappointed that all their kid could do was hear well.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	328	[what]
Yoku3_57e0660e		It’s obvious I’ve hit close to the mark. Or at least, he’s afraid I have.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	335	[what]
Yoku3_26726d67		I think my head’s spinning. This is a lot to take in at once.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	342	[what]
Yoku3_2e6dcd90		At least he has some sense in him.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	353	[what]
Yoku3_6b997ff0		I’ve never seen him speak with such passion before. Well, about something positive, that is.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	400	[what]
Yoku3_150f44ae		This again.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	405	[what]
Yoku3_6cc59dcc		I… I don’t think I’ve actually thought about it. I mean, technically I’m forced to be here, but I can’t tell him that. 	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	409	[what]
Yoku4_e52f7711		After our last talk I hadn’t expected Yoku to reach out to me of his own volition.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	426	[what]
Yoku4_a845e667		He said he wanted to talk to me about something, but he’s just been kinda staring at me intently. I feel like prey.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	427	[what]
Yoku4_4b13ce6e		Oh, I don’t like where this is going.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	439	[what]
Yoku4_6bf76a2b		He handed me a pair of headphones.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	449	[what]
Yoku4_f2722dae		He fumbled with the controls and soon followed the sound of a violin accompanied by a piano. It was a strange duet. A little tinny, but good. He was staring me down as I listened.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	455	[what]
Yoku4_beacdede		He nodded, seemingly in deep thought.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	581	[what]
Yoku4_d06899ac		Hunh?	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	585	[what]
Yoku4_55cc0ddd		Wow	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	590	[what]
Yoku4_1391e2d6		Just… I’m not sure how to feel.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	591	[what]
Yoku4_1ca1c4e5		Having someone like that in my corner would definitely benefit me in the future.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	592	[what]
Yoku4_cd4fb8ed		Provided he’s able to actually market himself as a musician. I gotta make sure that dork doesn’t get himself into trouble.	game/text/yoku_pathway.rpy	593	[what]
